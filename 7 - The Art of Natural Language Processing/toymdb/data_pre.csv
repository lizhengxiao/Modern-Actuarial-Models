review,sentiment
i enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so i wasn t able to watch them all i was surprised when it didn t return and had no i idea why still don t know but i guess that s not important great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years later the characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars that sort of thing a little woody allenish in a way ,1
kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama and the acting is true to the story with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale it is touching funny and intriguing in all parts the character development is near perfect the cinematography is vivid and engaging and the story draws you in i would like to say that the samurai freaks and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa s best work perhaps not his best but even at his worst kurosawa is better than many of the best this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change that it is timeless despite being set in the not so distant past i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based ,1
i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first time production one interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city brooklyn in specific the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life again kudos to the director on this fine choice this is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it i m sure it will make it to the screen ,1
really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makers if you re going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking there seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits the werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didn t even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wrists i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie no reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video ,0
obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie so don t even look at the credits at the end you ll only hold it against them nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie only 3 were in the theater two passed out after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones the monsters were the unemployed worm from star trek 2 the wrath of khan and rejected designs for the space creatures in alien the creators of the movie obviously didn t want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn t get to memorize their lines or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening if anything is if you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing and you don t pass out you ll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film the implausibility of several scenes will just stun you and stephen dorff s regular spewing of the queen mary of curse words conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this if you must see this movie do yourself a favor and wait until it s in the bargain bin at the video store if there s any justice in the film industry one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you ,0
this all but ignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following head was written by jack nicholson rafelson and peter tork during a three day lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel the other three monkees only acted in it they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script they deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge for instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame by frame you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells cut the monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come at every turn they realize their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can t escape being in you say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set s background no problem hey hey they re the monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around in the end even their deaths did not set them free that was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world they did it through the power of their music ironically near the end peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens peter realizes it doesn t matter if we re in the box the film he means that it doesn t matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur you need to just let now happen as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definition when you can t even tell the difference will being free or not doesn t matter tying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of time i saw this film at a very important time in my life i was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun i e sex like everyone else did but the revelation in head broke my self imposed recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever know for decades i ve watched head and wished i could thank pete was this a good movie uhh how about like ,1
got to this show late believe it was the 3rd and final episode when first watched it and was blown away by a social commentary that hasn t been seen on american tv since all in the family was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first place which is merely to say the last time cbs had a set if you know what i mean was back in the day of all in the family the most controversial decision they re willing to tackle today is how much eye make up to put on katie couric if you want to make a bunch of folks really really mad let them discover the truth about themselves and if you want them willing to pull strings make calls and get a work of art removed let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve and this show is no different somehow it snuck under the cbs corporate social political censor radar to get it onto the schedule perhaps the big brass never really watched it till it finally aired but once good ol middle merika heard and saw themselves being themselves well can bet the farm that message or the messenger won t last long now if only the missing episodes can find their way onto usenet or bit torrent thank you bc kelly tallahassee fla;),1
stefan is an x con that five years ago got married to marie their marriage has been stable until stefan past catch up with them and he s offered to do a courier job stefan s job is a heroin delivery from germany to sweden which should go easily in germany stefan meet elli a girl from bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help elli out of her misery due to the fact that elli s father during the war fleed to sweden elli now goes with stefan to sweden to make up with the past stefan promises elli to help her find her father no matter what it takes finally back in sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than stefan ever thought of this movie doesn t seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it s been americanized alot regina lund and cecilia bergqvist makes it all average the effects makes the movie a little too much though see it and jugde for yourself ,0
i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he s unconscious the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the pushover he was the last but not least was noah gray cabey franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can t act eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining ,0
i don t really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation unfortunatly it was misplaced firstly this is not horror it doesn t scare and unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for which is possible doesn t try to it s a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1 this film ripps of gremlins in a truly special way i can t claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more very very bad avoid ,0
this is beyond stupid two high school graduates travel to nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting demi moore co stars in this one as the film was in 1986 was ashton kutcher just a babe in the woods at that time moore s grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean bobcat goldthwait with that obnoxious voice is in the film as well as two brothers who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent the writing is absolutely ridiculous highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other did you ever notice that when people die they go alphabetically in the papers i rest my case ,0
silly movie is really really funny yes it s got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but it s laugh out loud funny all the way and it s worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook this movie is in the same class as elvira mistress of the dark another incredibly funny underappreciated film ,1
the eternal jew der ewige jude does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says it simply says without opposition what it wants us to believe one will concede that american newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker hippler was preaching to the converted not so much asking gentile europeans to hate the jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed the weakest link in the film s logic shows in its rat analogy wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of well jewish people are like that too similarly it characterizes jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad the film appears to contradict itself a few times for example by attacking western painters who portrayed old testament characters as light skinned europeans thereby the text admits that so called hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of christian culture it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roach infested filth despite the supposed treasure they ve hoarded and then flip flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto incidentally who wouldn t the use of scenes from a well known american film house of rothschild shows an equally blurry deployment of logic first the film is denounced as having been made by jews then it is apparently used by hippler to verify the deceptiveness of jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto jews shown as a means of avoiding taxation although the rothschild character s spin is that jews are taxed excessively finally the rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account this apparent indecisiveness in whether the american footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching for all of eternal jew s imperfections i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a 5 to date i d say the reason is that ej s documentary value has exceeded its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence needless to say the film s very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a propagandist s tool about this time i should expect director hippler to flip flop once again springing forward to say that s what i meant to do all along the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly inhumane contrary to the intent of kosher law to prevent animal suffering i would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these procedures to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate ,0
a meteor crashes into crater lake the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch alright so the plot is just trash but despite its obvious low budget this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster on the loose films in existence there are also some good moments of humor in an age filled so called monsters which are no more than laughable men in rubber suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces cheap exploitation style it s refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen style stop motion creature quite a hard film to find but it s worth finding ,1
wow thank god i was on an airplane and could look out the window bad hollywood fire scenes predictable terribly acted who the hell was that awful woman who played the wife badly casted awfully written this movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person who s willing to kneel at the alter of either firemen specifically heroes or gods in general i suppose i just don t have enough bad things to say about this film it couldn t have been cheap either with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes had to have cost a fortune yet it still sucked worse than any movie i can even remember seeing funeral scene astonishingly bad courtship between fireman and aforementioned awful woman corny contrived trite firehouse pranks don t we all wish we could be both so manly and churlish at the same time ,0
worst movie of all time wow whoa now you cannot be serious maybe it s all about what you expect a movie to do to you i live in oregon so i got to enjoy the beautifully filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy s cradle at the beginning of the movie those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than average score or maybe it s all about what expectations you have having read the book ages ago and thinking to myself goodness no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting quirky weird book especially 20 years later when mores morays can t put in the accent mark online have changed i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again sissy was exquisitely cast and i don t care what you all say i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix s and john hurt s performances i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray and those real folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted stilted a bit stage ey always a bit on gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book imho ,1
dear richard i know we all loved you on home improvement with tim allen but seriously do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to air bud i would have thought tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant i know that seems ironic but the pay benefits are much more rewarding everybody would see you around tim and instantly think tool time you would even get roles with bob vila more often instead you appear for 10 minutes with a golden retriever and smiling i know there wasn t much of a script but you could have added to it i mean come on tim owes you one but seriously this movie does nothing for the air bud line quite the contrary the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports the original was better and you mr richard karn know that more than anybody this is an f movie ,0
i remember watching this as a child in the uk mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier s narration we would talk about nothing else at school the next day i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals the suffering of german troops on the eastern front the maltreatment of japanese prisoners of war by american troops the images of the holocaust made me a non jewish european feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people i don t know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries spoiler we win ,1
just plain terrible nick and michael are way better actors than this a c rated flick at best the plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped even the film and sound quality was terrible i suppose that these were all young actors at the time and this script just filled a job nitch ,0
great film a very worthy 7 10 tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the 80s this film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved i e ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about this film was good it was a well deserved 7 10 it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isn t your thing ,1
step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break the film is average in every way with little more for the viewer a jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special the acting was fine but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story none the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film there were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard this is a class b film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps the scenery was good and the characters held true to life it is worth the watch if you like that kind of film ,0
well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don t consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman s best ,1
this film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny it s just that there is nothing of interest in this film there are no real jokes that make you amused you just watch for 80 minutes then turn it off i bought this on very budget dvd and i m glad because it s not worth much this isn t even one of those films that s so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk high and have a good giggle i didn t hate it like i hate some films but it is rather boring and not worth investing any time in the only people who voted 10 on the votes for this film must have been connected to it somehow because i cannot imagine anyone actually liking this film other than small children passing time,0
this movie is a hidden gem i can t understand why this movie doesn t get more air time errol and eleanor parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple and their chemistry is impeccable i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn it s nice to see errol playing a father as well by all accounts from his very own children he was a very attentive and loving father in real life also the supporting cast is wonderful as well you can t go wrong with supporting players such as hattie mcdaniel and lucile watson hattie mcdaniel makes a movie that much better from the get go this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home enjoy ,1
i like the show but come on writers get some action in it quit dragging it on and on you have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more miles jenkins is great and performs as a kid that age should act in the situation he finds himself in hey get creative with the creatures they may have telepathic capabilities or other out worldly powers the kid actors in the series are very good and convincing the parents of miles do appear to be a little too out of sense as to what is going on but develop this come on you have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist to next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of neat sci fi stuff if they could make a series on a witch then you should be able to make one on these creatures and kids ,1
this might be unbelievable but this movie has grossed 878 138 in russia it s shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running well i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh movie which had almost no screening around the world that s some kind of enigma haha maybe it was based on the fact that another movie pledge this with paris hilton which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln besides both movies had a lot of promotion like there were the banners all over the city tv commercials and etc speaking about movie i d say it s dull and absolutely boring it could be better really even if it has jessica simpson ,0
 i cannot believe i was hooked on this show instantly after seeing the first scene i was in it deep anyway first of all the guys are hot cappy evan calvin fischer cappy heath cappy etc secondly the girls are cute sexy smart and are not afraid of being called bitches i like that which at the same time doesn t make them mean and greedy just realistic third the relationships are so great especially casey and cappy lately every show turns very away from it s original path and people end up with someone who wasn t even in the first season cappy and casey s relationship is true love a kind that lasts they loved each other throughout the years and it didn t end when a guest star appeared in todays world maybe it s kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens and people define each other in college so i knew exactly who i wanted to be with in college just like casey and cappy i hope there are many more seasons of this show and i hope we can see the relationship between casey and cappy now that they will probably stay together at thanksgiving love this show,1
being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg as an actor that made me even more anxious to check out this flick i remember he was interviewed on jay leno and said that he turned down a role in the big budget adam sandler comedy the longest yard to be in this film so obviously snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops i m not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in the tenants there are certainly better rapper actors like mos def who could ve done more with his role but the point is snoop did a good job he can t seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections but that s something even jack nicholson has a problem doing the point is i found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott s character captivating mcdermott by the way gives the best performance in the film though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop s not so subtle acting being a big reader and aspiring writer myself i couldn t help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating it did aggravate me how snoop s character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work and berate him for criticizing it but you know what i m sure a lot of writers are like that his character was supposed to be flawed as was mcdermott s in his own way my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending for some reason it just felt too rushed for me though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than plot ,1
now i know that sandra bullock produced this film but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the story like not trying to make the whole movie about her character the story is about two high school students one rich and popular the other smart and anti social who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by the number just to see if they can get away with it enter sandra bullock and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case the boys have planted evidence created alibis and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be this movie could have been a great little hitchcock style thriller but the movie spends too much time on getting to know sandra s character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself you see something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film and we get to know all about it all about it it just gets rather tedious after a while especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past ryan gosling and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller with the way it is most of the thrill is lost they should have cut out all the stuff with sandra s character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel but i digress it s still an entertaining movie nonetheless i do recommend this movie but wait for the video dvd ,1
this movie is só incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry the cliché are put on thicker than 5 year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart every single joke was badly timed and wouldn t have been funny if it were timed correctly don t see this movie there s a real chance you ll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again ever ,0
the thing that stands out in my mind in this film sadly is the introduction where john berlin andy garcia is driving into town you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees it s quite beautiful as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin well andy is just too hispanic latin for it to be passable maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story who knows but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks he stands out like a sore thumb especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry yeah i know big deal right he s still a good actor the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness don t ask appears helena robertson uma thurman thurman does a good job of playing a blind person to my surprise when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt freddy ross i got worried henriksen s played in some pretty strange films especially of late i still can t forget him in the bloodbath movie pumpkinhead berlin movies into a small town from l a as a detective he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far fetched so did the irony of spoiler freddy s murder with the recording and name similarities i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight jennifers and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn t pack much of a punch in retrospect this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out as to the ending it is a bit of a surprise but is highly arguable much like sgt ross murder the killer chooses to walk after his running victim opting instead to frolick i guess and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it s ridiculous i won t ruin the very end because despite it s shakiness it s a good surprise afterward though you ll probably say as i did boy was she lucky 4 10,0
this is a charming movie starring everyone s favorite cartoon chipmunks in this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world although there are lows including an orphan penguin all in all it s a great family film ,1
this is the best direct to dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme s best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed 2 adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isn t quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van damme s character s motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you don t find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain t character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border ,1
this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio two they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie i maintain the only way for these two books vampire lestat and queen of the damned to work in a live action form would be through a mini series first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the 1700 s to the 1980 s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed lestat was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with akasha s plans marius did not make lestat lestat did not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong basically same names different story if they wanted to make a vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine but don t piggie back into the theaters off the success of rice s great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love if you haven t read the books you won t understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch 22 must see it will hate it ,0
i was probably one of the few australians not watching the tennis when this series aired i have to say when william mcinnes first appeared i though that is one crappy actor but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh i watched the show to see hugo speers heart and bones the full monty and tom long seachange two hands it was interesting to see speers play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom longs rippling muscles sigh seriously long s performance was a total shock and really brilliant he stole the show martin sacks was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance i d recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on ,1
charles bronson continued his 80 s slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade if not ever in it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder it s a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made a lot of people consider the death wish sequels to be bronson s worst movies the death wish sequels weren t great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation it really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a law and justice mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo the chicago theater i watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film it has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn t well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save i want to point out that i think charles bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst the action sequences are poor also 1 2 out of 4 awful ,0
great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced montand gives the concept of the lone wolf police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and most importantly credibility when a typical hollywood cop heroe loses family friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief but when the sixty seconds are over he pulls himself together packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one montand s marc ferrot however is really devastated by his girlfriends murder of course but also by finding out that she had another lover in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene thus all his actions become unescapably logical this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one ,1

one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time terry june was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the 70 s and 80 s it started life as happy ever after but when eric merriman decided he didn t want to write any more it changed into this hence the dropping of aunt lucy and the fletcher s becoming the medford s yes it was cosy domestic middle class stuff the plots ran the gamut of clichés from the boss coming to dinner the vicar organising a jumble sale and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend it was certainly not dreadful lazy comedy as for it being not clever it was not meant to be it was funny and well performed and that was enough i too loved the alternative boom of the 80 s spitting image black adder the young ones etc but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this if nothing else it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill well family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens but where has it left us take a look at the latest t v schedules all soaps and reality dross the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers meaning they are jam packed with swearing bodily function jokes and explicit sexual references and they are not remotely funny either the alternative comedy boom was good in many ways but had a dark side it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as little britain and tittybangbang heaven help us if it ain t broke don t fix it ,1
when this cartoon first aired i was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent boy was i wrong i must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching batman and robin with george clooney all those years ago i watched a few episodes and two of them had batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like jet li and beat the crap out of batman and i watched another episode where batman got his butt kicked again by the joker who apparently was using jackie chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja since when were the joker or the penguin ever a match for batman and worse yet when were joker and penguin kung fu counterparts of jackie chan and jet li it s truly embarrassing depressing and sad the way the image of batman is portrayed in this show the animation is awful and the dialog is terrible being a batman fan since my boyhood i can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost because it doesn t project the true image of batman this cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really wanna see a classic batman cartoon i strongly recommend batman the animated series but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of s t get batman the animates series and don t waste your time with this cartoon ,0
this is the first and as far as i can tell the only completed production of heart of darkness ever released prior to starting on citizen kane orson welles shot some test footage for a version of heart of darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called pov where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors windows water etc the film was never made the pov technique was used not too successfully in 1947 in the lady in the lake with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe presumably the coincidence of the two marlow e characters is just that of course francis coppola s apocalypse now was based on heart of darkness the short novel heart of darkness by the polish born british writer joseph conrad first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899 features one of his favorite alter egos ship captain charlie marlow who also narrates the short story youth and indirectly tells the story of lord jim marlow temporarily out of work decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold ii s personal fiefdom the cruelly misnamed congo free state marlow travels from london to brussels signs on with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the company s most productive agents in the colony a german named kurtz shipments of ivory latex for the production of rubber and other products from kurtz s station have ceased and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time there are rumors that he has gone native marlow is to investigate take any necessary action and make a report on his return he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast and finally sets out upriver to find kurtz s station the river the heat the vegetation the wildlife the insects the people all take their toll on his endurance his imagination and his mental resources he finds kurtz ill half mad and close to death the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics this heart of darkness was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like but the rest of the film was forgettable tim roth does his best as marlow but so much about the plot characterizations and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered if the aim was to make conrad s story for the screen why didn t they leave it alone it s unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role everything about him is wrong his looks his acting style his voice his accent everything a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz unlike malkovich an actual german like the character this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you ve read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900 ,0
this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years it came on the disney channel in the wee hours of the morning i stayed up to watch it and found it even more entertaining than the first time the story the scenery and the characters are as good as they come i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time it s very memorable in more ways than one i would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned s,1
the end of suburbia is an important documentary about modern dependence on cheap energy and the coming peak in world oil production the film is an excellent introduction to the peak oil phenomenon and includes interviews with experts like adviser to vice president dick cheney s 2001 energy task force mathew simmons author richard heinberg powerdown options and actions for a post carbon world and author michael t klare blood and oil the dangers and consequences of america s growing dependency on imported petroleum economic growth is predicated upon more electricity electricity is predicated on hydro carbon energy period and mathew simmons made a very clear statement he said future growth is not possible and for a guy from his background to say that was one of the most that s like the catholic church saying the earth is round before galileo michael c ruppert the peak has happened and now instead of being prophets we re now historians kenneth deffeyes,1
 nicodemus is almost a copy of red in the odd behavior sense but this episode focuses on other people in clark kent s unpredictable life when a poisonous flower finds it s way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan he becomes short tempered and violent however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out okay so far so good next up is lana the episode was good up to that point for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark at the last moment he refuses her but the damage has already been done this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn t suitable for people under the age of twenty due to it s adult content the first part was good the last part focusing on the effect the flower has on pete was good but the middle that was all about lana s alternate personality was most defiantly not and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode i give this episode two ,0
without peter ustinov and maggie smith this could easily have been a turkey but they are brilliant ustinov is at his best and for fans of maggie it is great to see her in her early days matching ustinov every step of the way for with and timing for englishmen in their fifties and i am in that bracket it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the swinging sixties and although this film spends a lot of time in offices it has plenty of sixties nostalgia including red buses carnaby street a song by lulu and a delicious shot up the micro skirt of a waitress the like of which england has never seen since in public places as an i t engineer i know that the computer hacking tricks are laughable but they are not meant to be taken seriously nor are the wonderful stereotypes of italians french and germans ,1
this film is pretty poor the acting is abysmal and completely forced furthermore by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn t necessarily make it more believable you can t get out of it that easily mr dir don t let my comments mislead you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes however the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish there is no other way to put it it pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere what takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances no instead it leaves you with jaw dropping was that it spilling from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point zero day indeed zzzzzzzzzzzzz,0
i must say i m an avid horror movie fan and currently i can t get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gore this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m night s sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good 40 mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isn t too much i ve never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that it s great ,1
this is one of those westerns that well stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog very few can hold up to it over the long haul that said the rest is pretty bad nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch junior bonner and perhaps a few more it is riddled with weaknesses john drew barrimore the most glaring however it does have one truly memorable scene nothing like it its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight wonderful stuff right up with the best in any western ,1
three young movie theater employees are given the task of re opening a long closed old time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own as they approach the grand re opening night things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises oh this is truly horrible in fact if it wasn t for mary woronov s secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy selina this would be a total loss the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive albeit not overly gory a preference for me but not necessarily for others fashion the rest just wallows in constant sleaze so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine ,0
wow wow wow i have never seen a non preachy documentary on globalization until i saw mardi gras made in china this film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound they play with toys jump rope and dance yet the majority of their days and nights consist of work work and work but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he punishes the workers astutely following mardi gras beads from china to the carnival the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting compelling footage from both cultures one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and mardi gras revelers to each other through pictures here the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation the film is never preachy is not guilt driven and allows everyone s point of view to be present at the end we the viewers make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization ,1
 black dragons 1942 william nigh bela lugosi joan barclay clayton moore just prior to the start of world war ii dr melcher bela lugosi a world famous surgeon is brought in by japan s black dragon society as part of a secret plan dr melcher operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look alikes with their operatives in place the black dragon society s plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but the f b i chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot according to the dvd sleeve s synopsis that synopsis gives away the entire ending which in this case might be a good thing black dragons is an incredible wildly inconsistent muddle a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle in early scenes mr lugosi as monsieur colomb is effectively creepy confusing joan barclay as alice saunders future lone ranger clayton moore as dick martin along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along ,0
i don t know if this type of movie was as cliché then as it seems to be now considering how many bad news bears films had already been released by 1980 however i think that this sort of movie was already a tired idea a former football player is partially paralyzed in vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair the chicago bears offer him a pr job but he wants to coach at the same time his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery we are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard time which turns out to be less than a year of course the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male role model in his life the same goes for all of the kids in the detention facility yes even the one locked up for attempted murder i m sure you already know what happens so i ll try and keep the rest of this brief our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids football team he overcomes the delinquents cynicism and earns their respect his team faces off against a local high school team yeah right and they get their butts kicked now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach he demands a rematch will these underprivileged scrappy kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch awful execution of the football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film coach of the year should get penalized for roughing my brain 1 10,0
forget every spy movie you ve ever seen this is what life was like in the ussr and still is in many places in russia and the ex soviet countries vera dreams of life of leisure as she imagines the west to be her reality is very different with a bitter mother a violent father and the ever present alcohol and her prospects for the future are not much better she finds a man and they try to patch up a life together but he is afflicted by the same environment both socially and physically the scenery in this movie is brilliant sitting comfortably in the company of post apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera forget your stereotyped cold russians of spy movies this is the real deal people are passionate vibrant and present in a way you ll never see in a drama from the west ,1
 hot millions is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the marvelous cast assembled for it the movie is a tribute to the genius of peter ustinov who wrote the screen play and appears as the key figure of an enterprising embezzler the movie directed by eric till doesn t show signs of having dated as terribly as some others from that period at the center of the action is a friendly man marcus pendleton who before being released from prison fixes the income tax forms for the warden who is amazed of the refund he is owed by the government marcus who is a genius at numbers sees opportunities where others wouldn t he starts working for a firm that uses the latest computer for its accounting but pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different phony accounts in different parts of the continent marcus is assigned a secretary who also happens to have a flat in his building the inept patty is seen working as a bus fare taker who manages to make a mess of everything how she lands a job as a secretary is beyond comprehension but things are never the same in the office when the creepy willard gnatpole decides to go after her but have no fear patty s heart belongs to marcus who is an accomplished pianist and she is a flutist and they make beautiful music together the best thing in the film is peter ustinov he clearly understood how marcus should be played and runs away with the film mr ustinov gives an assured account of the embezzler the excellent maggie smith is also at her best with her take on patty the kind woman who adores marcus and who proves to be a genius herself when it comes to investing the money she finds in marcus pockets karl malden is perfect as the american in charge of the corporation bob newhart also appears as gnatpole the man who desires patty but can t get her to reciprocate the marvelous robert morley is seen as caesar smith whose identity marcus has assumed cesar romero appears also in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector hot millions will delight everyone looking for a fun time in the company of that unsavory but charming character marcus pendleton ,1
i saw grande ecole at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival i had no idea what i was entering and if i d had any idea i wouldn t have entered this is the most pretentious film i ve seen for a long time it tries to be provocative yet deep with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes it doesn t succeed it s nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen 4 10,0
this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through and that s saying alot because i ve seen my share of horrible movies but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser seriously there was not one respectable character in the entire script how fitting that the plot was equally lame lacking any intelligence whatsoever i can t believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity and while i haven t seen all of their other movies i ve always enjoyed their performances until now it s not that the acting was bad just the entire story line was moronic ,0
i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people as a member of the church the single most disturbing aspect of the film most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had knowingly deceived church members into believing he had been called to be joseph s successor as the prophet although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact when in reality both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints rather he led them confidently by inspiration the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith that god truly speaks to prophets today and that brigham young like joseph smith was an inspired prophet of god whether or not you believe this statement or not just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed ,1
ok so maybe it s because i m from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite effected when they died in particulare when the captain finally fell the script well it s a game of 2 halfs the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton ,1
the title says it all i m not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie obviously this movie didn t have a multi million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd i ll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films dylan o leary cast and crew i thank you ,1
i don t often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this doesn t come close while the premise change in colour gender whatever is bad enough and has been done better many times before the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make up people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague ,0
bad movie it s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown ups i just saw it because i m a robin williams fan and i was very disappointed ,0
firstly this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen it incorporates perfectly timed slapstick sexual humour and cleverly thought up stand up but it goes deeper than that the souler opposite is an original love story something we don t see that often that gave me hope that there is love out there that two people who love each other can work through their adversity and that such a comedic take on life something i believe we all should have can be accepted by the people that really matter chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future ,1

i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes almost got cast as the muscle guy since the real muscle guy was really really late that day pauly had my brother and i the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing this movie is really good as well would it have made my top 100 if i wasn t in it ,1
the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money i bought it ex rental for 3 00 it looked interesting so i took a chance within minutes of turning it on i realised i d made a mistake the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire where they could meet more of their kind as for the devin hamilton writer and director he should just be shot sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish avoid this film if you see it in the shops run away 1 10,0
this movie was rather awful vipul shah s last movie was good this one was just bad although it s a good story and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play avjo wahala fari malishu made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it s still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and don t work well but they re still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch it s still a story to take in to account and it s good if you re the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that s really not needed even one bit,1
this film is full of interesting ideas some scenes are truly hilarious the dialogs are witty and colloquial the tension in the film comes not so much from the murder mystery plot as from the relationship between the characters the film tells two stories in parallel the first story involves the characters played by trintignant and kassovitz trintignant is an ageing drifter with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness who is followed by a naive young man played by kassovitz with plenty of good natured smiles many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters for example when trintignant tries to teach kassovitz how to be intimidating the second story tells how a salesman played by jean yanne gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony i wish i could describe this better after a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end in a surprising but also logical ending the film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director s father the celebrated michel audiard used to write and the typical french film with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions ,1
well let s be fair following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task now subtract swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task so with patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage i am going to blame the director who didn t even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film i was actually shocked they got will patton armaggedon to jump on board johnathon schaech did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious turning down his partner brunette bombshell crystal mantecon in the film s first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double duece no such luck the cover of the dvd is hilarious they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film costar ellen hollman actually puts in a decent performance as well but again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment even one of the old bouncers or two or jeff healey for a performance would have been nice take this film out of your queue immediately lostflix,0
totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor i loved it it is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film except for nicolas read who plays an un dead court jester to comic brilliance but being that as it may i laughed so many times and i have to hand it to the film makers it wasn t pretentious or ordinary in any way raping fighting zombies vomitting on their rape victims what other movie has this not for the quesy but with a pizza a bong and a six pack of beer you got it made if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself ,1
if you have not heard of this film from walt disney pictures do not worry about it it would be classed along the other films by disney that are meant for educational purposes like family planning it was co produced with kotex to teach pre teen girls about menstruation supposably it only educates at a superficial level so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated ram s head reproductive system sequence the film does show the wonderful world of disney elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the story this film is impossible to find so if you can find the film best luck to you and enjoy ,1
i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me if you want a total b movie this is a good pick but don t expect too much from aliens dwarf size,0
okay first of all i missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie so i missed credits and stuff so when i finally got to it i was like who the hell is this dude i found out it was flex like hours after watching the movie flex didn t look like michael jackson not one bit he couldn t dance like him or move like him the only thing he almost had was the voice people commented on elizabeth taylor but i can t really comment on that because i don t know much about her the whole movie was like just plain wack the dialogue sucked the cinematography if it can be called that sucked the soundtrack sucked the acting sucked yes even flex i m so upset about it though i didn t want it to suck i m so sad that flex got told he can get away with it but the whole thing looked like dress up you know it s like nobody looked like they were supposed to except for joseph jackson the concert sequences just sucked i m sorry but flex just can t dance like michael i mean like what the hell was vh1 thinking the makeup didn t even match like the time of whatever michael was going through for example in the movie he was still dark when neverland got raided the first time around in real life mj was white as hell there was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring the movie wasn t boring well for me it wasn t it wasn t really anything i was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it i wanted to see how it turned out and if flex could redeem himself he didn t really the only part i found like a bit interesting was the whole lisa marie thing when they fell in love that was nice but i had to turn my face away when they kissed heh and only two parts made me collapse with laughter the first time was when they cut from michael with short hair you know the thriller era to michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era and he was still black that was funny the second time i laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of michael but they had flex s face instead it was so funny overall this movie was cheap trash it was simply two hours of dress up and could have been so much better but no vh1 is cheap watch if you want but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it i came out of it feeling angry and when i found out it was flex i just started to feel so bad so watch if you want ,0

8 2008 when i originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film i took a critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically phoned in their performances which paired them in a manner they d done several times previously but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main mega stars lived a great deal longer after its release with the exception of spiner all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise unavoidably a lot longer in tooth than we ve seen in many of their other film and t v work but isn t almost everyone seeing it again while it certainly won t be regarded as a classis in any of their careers it is a fun film with a lot of interesting scenery as well from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting a film to be another citizen kane casablance or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast ,1
okay look i ve seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films you know the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it well i got got again and i m getting pretty tired of it but i digress it s pretty simple it sucked i know rather juvenile but it did andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive distractingly so if i may add and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain grief over the death of her daughter did little help i mean jesus oh but the crawling on her back demon thingee was pretty neat ,0
i loved long way round and wasn t even aware of race to dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket i bought it and after a slightly hmm will this be as good first episode i decided that it was charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew great to see him with ewan again there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn t bother me as for their being no mention of it on the package thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have they should have given it a 15 just for the language alone highly recommended series i want more ,1

a woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides then again are these really suicides it seems as though there s a ghost on the loose guess what the ghost has long black hair that hides its face and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that making for a very weird looking specter recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost and bizarre sound effects which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped always accompany this hapless spirit does any of this sound familiar well if you ve seen a few asian horror movies in the last 10 years it should borrowing heavily and unabashedly from the ring one last call and a few other recent horror hits this film tries to carry an uninteresting and worn out plot to a climax but we ve seen it all before avoid it unless you re desperate or haven t seen any other asian horror movies in the last 10 years ,0
the movie slugs is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry you see these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and don t mean to do anything malicious they re just slugs slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison but slugs none the less the real bad guys are the humans who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs or overreact when they encounter them for example take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs they were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them and they reacted instinctively defending themselves and biting the guy now instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot spills some highly volatile chemicals starts a fire knocks a bookcase over on himself and cuts off his own hand then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes how can you blame that on the slugs this movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable the characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody the drunk hick who s mean to his dog and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty five years older than him there s also a set of drunken teensthat get attacked while copulating and we have to see the skinny long haired freaks genitals meanwhile there s a guy who looks like a demonic leslie neilson who yells you don t have the authority to declare happy birthday for some reason finally this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the mst3k classic pod people whose face explodes after eating a slug laces salad another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful harmless slugs humans are portrayed as greedy stupid racist alcoholic and in one pointless scene as would be rapists in the movie s climactic scene the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers well since they re idiots the humans succeed in blowing up the entire town they alone do more damage than the slugs ever did if you hate humans and i know i do you ll appreciate slugs if you re a fan of bad cinema you ll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of pieces and pod people there s enough bad acting silly dialog illogical plot twists lame special effects pointless scenes and poor dubbing to hold your attention ,0
i ve just been at the cinema in down town prague watching this film not due to the poster i found very holywood old fashioned heroicstyle not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostof those high starring french films are usually pathetic but justbecause there are not so many films in my french mother tongue in acity like prague and because i love adjani depardieu and rappenau scyrano then i decided to write up this small comment because i thinki really don t agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb i was not disappointed the film just look like the poster thecharacters are just as stupid as they look like for a while ithought adjani would be like a caricature just a funny characteryou can laugh at no she is not for example when she decides to telldepardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebeginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticmusic which should make you cry and realize adajani s character is adeeper person as she looks like maybe this was humor at the 10thlevel but i am sorry my sense of humor is not that high if i want tosee some funny french film on the wwii i watch once again la grandevadrouille it is definitively more fun i have also read on imdbthat lemoine is making a great performance in this film i have tosay i have never seen a so bad acting well i have never seen any edwood s film nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good very costly scenes like the one with the pantheon in the morningwhen the german army arrives at paris or when the refugees settle downon a bridge in bordeaux i think rappeneau is a good filmmaker butthat he does better with a good script it was easy with cyrano hehad not to write the dialogs i give 1 10 ,0
i typically don t like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of american idol s success but this one i can live with comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do survivor style competitions using comedic tactics then one will be determined as last comic standing i do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden ralphie may and josh blue my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama at first they lived together in a house like big brother but now they ve done away with that thank god and there are a lot of comedians i felt were only chosen not because they re funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc when other comics clearly should ve beaten them out but overall it s a well made reality show which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron ,1
growing up in nyc in the late 80 s early 90 s club scene i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights voguing allowed people to fight within the confines of everything short of touching each other which would warrant an automatic disqualification seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented well orchestrated throw downs in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here pepper la beija paris duprée xtragavaganza etc all commemorated in the likes of such period pieces as malcom mclaren s song deep in vogue it didn t matter who you were or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this magic kingdom of sorts you became part of something bigger than yourself you were important and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination and anybody from anywhere could become king or queen as the case may have been the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor all of the tension excitement and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film brilliant please release on dvd for the world to see thank you ,1
a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was elated when this movie came out in 1994 i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away revolted and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese top and it is not very funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom line 1 star don t even bother ,0
sometimes hallmark can get it right like the 10th kingdom but many of their fantasy films plod and this falls into the latter category the version i saw may have been cut a demon shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn t appear but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing possible spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the original fairy tale anyway the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th century and makes gerda and kay here called kai being a lexx fan i kept expecting him to say the dead do not solve puzzles 18 year olds hans christian andersen s basic story is followed the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye goes bad is taken off by the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and gerda goes to find him having various adventures on the way as the two main characters are older than in the original a lot of time is spent getting them together and in love unfortunately i was never convinced that they were particularly in love and certainly not enough in love to make sense of gerda s quest by the time the main plot kicks in the movie s pace has slowed to a crawl alas when gerda begins her search for kai it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll there are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere at the start of the film the snow queen kills gerda s mother but no explanation for this is given a polar bear living in the snow queen s palace is more than he seems though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear s feelings towards the snow queen would be ok in a fairy tale but not in a modern film again this is never explained also hints that the snow queen has an erotic desire for kai are dropped but never followed through the script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the fairy tale mood the production looks good though there is evidence of penny pinching the snow queen s palace is the hotel where gerda and kai lived covered in ice the three main characters are played with varying degrees of success kai comes across as bland as does gerda initially but once she sets off to find kai you warm to her bridget fonda looks great as the snow queen but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else ultimately the film is unsatisfying it looks good but drags and lacks magic ,0
this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil like demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn t be worse the girl sees what she s done she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop tootsie songs made the film even better,1
one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an in name only sequel there s nothing wrong with that except this the return of chevy chase as ty webb this connects the viewer to this character from the original caddyshack in 1980 and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first one there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return he carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top jackie mason is the new rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are way different dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one robert stack airplane was good in the new ted knight villian role we miss you ted danny noonan should have been back so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one when you watch this film keep in mind that it isn t a major sequel and you may think it s another good or bad eighties comedy fans of the first should see it but don t be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart ,1
yes i spelled that right this movie is so predictable the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced it is paint by numbers as to where this plot will take us the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending catherine zeta jones and aaron eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably it s just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few sure it s an ok movie if you have nothing to watch but you won t miss anything by missing this one ,0
if i could give it less that 1 i would do not bother to rent if someone gives you the dvd burn it this is horrible movie making a total waste of even digital film i have seen better on youtube made by 12 year old boys lommel claims to have written this if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages the story line is none existent the dialog is mainly screaming the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift i can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a creative film i like david lynch this one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension i missed it or it is totally pointless i think this is a lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks con job i cannot see why lionsgate even bothered with this totally worthless it is so bad i will not rent any other by this same director ,0
i thought this movie was terrible i m chinese so i thought everything was totally wrong many of the facts were incorrect the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when wendy s mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded shihuangdi i also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake many of the actors and actresses were not very great some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid i think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get disney has really got to get more information about chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie mulan was quite accurate watch this movie if you want to waste some time ,0
about the movie itself there are ample comments i just wanted to say something about the german version which i have seen recently on tv it is heavily cut from 103 to 76 minutes it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv i understand the reasons for that but this movie was something else they did not only cut gore shots they have cut entire sequences sparing only glimpses like we have to attack them one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp protagonist running away when the assault on the island begins it isn t even possible anymore to follow the storyline all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic disconnected scenes that don t make any sense anymore i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense i think i would have given the original 7 10 the german version is worth only 1 10get it on dvd and check the runtime first or forget about it ,0
spend your time any other way even housework is better than this movie the jokes aren t funny the fun rhymes that are dr seus aren t there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids 4 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net my wife left and did dishes so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isn t funny isn t cute the cat s makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label ,0
what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturbing hilarious these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire from wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie you re about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets people s attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred so now we fast forward about 20 years 30 if you re honest about the hero s age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they don t seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame you re my sister he says to her while she s stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new love so anyway there s a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plot lines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special really special so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire you may be glad you did or not ,1
when the trailer for accepted first came up many people began to get excited about seeing it really excited who could blame them it looked like fun but that s exactly the thing people went into accepted looking for a good movie but if you think about it accepted isn t the type of film destined to be a good movie it s meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given that being said for those of you who expected a great film you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one think that and you will truly enjoy the film because you ll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic bottom line watch the movie and have fun but don t look for anything groundbreaking ,1
thank god i didn t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life f g visual effects unnecessary gore and nudity far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie ok if you get time after reading this comment please check out the director s ulli lommel profile after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2 and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie ,0
might contain spoilers this is just a good movie lots of good silly stuff to laugh at however do not watch the tv version they cut to much out dom deluise is rather awesome as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin all i can say about his ten minutes it s a long drive from jersey also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot also 12th century fox any bad stuff the rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated the songs were rather lame one time while watching this movie i could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2 on the whole however an enjoyable movie experience a must watch for comedy fans ,1
i saw this film right in the middle while going through a breakup it was about 3 in the morning and i was battling insomnia with a quick snack it wasn t too bad at the time but every time i have tried to watch it since i can t get into it like i did that night at the time i thought it was cute and i loved the variety of characters though they totally could have done better than goran v in my opinion but the one thing that kept me watching was heather s character and her sad commitment to her husband who didn t want her anymore which made me feel sorry for her and root for her at the same time considering i was in a similar situation at the time perhaps that s why i liked her so much not a bad film but you pretty much have to be somewhere near the character romantically in order to appreciate it and let s hope you never are ,0
i strongly recommend it to anybody who likes good plots good actors even if not well known often it s just better that way science and or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on the small screen good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it much better than any war in the stars there was only one comment which was not necessary talking about the comet the commentator says that life was maybe brought on earth through a comet that s fun there must be always a chance for a magic way huh that s what s great about life can come anywhere no need of extern force,1
i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in 1978 and is a very gripping read pun not intended it s not too difficult to read for those out there that don t read often so don t be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the 70 s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class it s a precious piece of melbourne history it s a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80 s soft porn movie it s far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in 1982 so don t expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it it s also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and it s great watching her really acting for if you re close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story ,1
destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized this game deserves all the recognition it deserves at a time when first person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers graphic adventures are a dying breed with great pun and humour the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island prediction the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too i guarantee it ,1
this film is deeply disappointing not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with j b lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories wenders s introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly alluding to world s culture or actually american culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid yawn i had expected more of him ,0
i kid you not yes who s that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonna s films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonna s character is relegated to being second fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in wtg madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonna s best and one of her most underrated films madonna plays nikki finn an ex con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn t commit she s being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays louden trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together that s when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy louden s rolls royce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunne s stuck up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jake s girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny that s how some of the best comedy should be played straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies it s still a fun screwball comedy of the 80s not for everyone i m sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it interesting note one of madonna s friends from her early 80s new york club days coati mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band ,1
after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast furious series so i already expected it to have a lacking storyline but at least this time it won t be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans unfortunately i was wrong if you could only imagine a fast furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen i m being nice no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said not only was the storyline non existent but the action was crap too i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie for an example there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a slr mclaren to win and after the bit where eddy griffin got in a fight with one of his girls an imus comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert after this wonderful scene i couldn t take it anymore so i only got to see half of this monstrosity this is the first movie i had ever walked out on afterwards i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option you re better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home i will keep all viewers in my prayers ,0
let me clarify that this is not a good movie but i am so glad it is out there i am so glad i saw it and for the role that it plays in my dvd collection it is sublime it is the ultimate pg 13 romp it is college as we imagine it will be when we re freshmen in high school it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on mars it is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn t make your grandmother uncomfortable watching it requires so little sophistication in fact thinking too hard about what s happening will get in the way of your appreciation of this work it makes me feel like i m 12 again and that kind of experience is worth more than 9 99 ,1
this is the lamest crappiest idiotic stupid movies i ever saw in my entire life i can t believe there are directors who make these kinds of movies this movie is a disgrace to horror genre acting oh no i couldn t bear it s full of anguish don t ever watch this movie you ll feel like u are being tortured to eternity please save yourself from the horrible fate of watching this movie if you really want to live don t watch it there are very good horror movies this movie doesn t deserve tat single vote too but i hate to vote if i want to post my comments ,0
i really like 101 dalmations when it came out in 1996 now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001 i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it s more funnier more humor and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version one hundred and one dalmations 1961 i wonder if there are plans for 103 dalmations i hope there is maybe yes maybe no all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future ,1
i m guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book given the number of characters and subplots during katyn i thought that the movie creators perhaps the writer or director intended to create an epic movie but really there wasn t enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story aggravatingly there were many unrelated side stories that could have been edited out in relating the events leading up to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers i don t think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary was it political philosophical revenge the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions instead the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons controlled entirely by stalin who s appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely one dimensional are polish people just that angry at the russians besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself i don t think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on hand held camera but if the director went with a character driven story perhaps by focusing on a single family maybe the handy cam approach would have worked better and if you use really dramatic music it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made ,0
some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing such is the case for carol s journey el viaje de carol a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel a boca de noche by ángel garcía roldán who also adapted the book as a screenplay war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre carol clara lago is a 12 year old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora maría barranco returns to her aurora s home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio álvaro de luna since his wife s death carol s father robert ben temple is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family aurora has a past she left her lover alfonso alberto jiménez to marry robert and alfonso in turn married aurora s cold sister dolores lucina gil carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her class tomiche juan josé ballesta and his two friends at first resent carol but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love when aurora dies of her illness carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca luna mcgill yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother s best friend and teacher maruja the always radiant rosa maria sardà to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime the ending though sad is uplifting as carol s journey to maturity is complete the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo f berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizábal director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war the cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan josé ballesta but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date grady harp,1
a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal canadiens receives much to his horror a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto montreal rivalry highly entertaining amusing and accurate ,1
young writers young auteur young cast busload of producers what could go wrong everything even lame is too good a description that suggests that three of four legs were functioning when actually none of them were barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour gratingly stretched to ninety minutes the audience was talking back to the screen so bad was the story dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker how many thousands of times has this been done on television bad cops frame good cops again how many times there was not an original shred in this entire concoction giovanni ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script drawing the only laughs of the entire movie and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me note to screenwriters buy one of those story generators it can t possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television note to auteur there are shots available to you other than closeups even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup note to cinematographer apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years you have much to learn note to color timer at the lab at least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don t know what they re talking about note to claire i hope this paid for your new condo it s time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on ,0
the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once you see humanity at its best and at it s worst you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something i implore you to watch this movie and take it s meaning to heart that there is only one true thing and that is love ,1
title zombie 3 1988 directors mostly lucio fulci but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei cast ottaviano dellacqua massimo vani beatrice ring deran serafin review to review this flick and get some good background of it i gotta start by the beginning and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead when dawn came out in 79 lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2 that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark ok so after that flick named zombie 2 in italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash the italians decided heck lets make some more zombie flicks these things are raking in the dough so zombie 3 was born confused yet the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we ve seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead lets see there s the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies canister gets released into the general population and shebang we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel they gotta fight the zombies to survive there was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie first and foremost lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick so he couldn t really finish this film the way that he wanted to the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei hell of the living dead and claudio fragasso zombie 4 they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good you see fulci himself didn t really have his heart and soul on this flick he was disenchanted with it he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said do whatever the hell you want with it and god love them they did and that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its director the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore there s no substance to it whatsoever after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies now in some cases this can prove to be fun if 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and 2 there s a lot of gore and guts involved here we get neither well there s some inspired moments in there like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people that was cool there s also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs but aside from that the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass endless upon endless scenes that don t do jack to move the already non existent plot along that was my main gripe with this flick the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non existent i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished i like my b movies but this one just really went even below that its closer to a z level flick if you ask me the zombie make up pure crap the zombies are all asian actors the movie was filmed in the philippines so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway its the look of the zombies that really sucks they all died with the same clothes on for some reason and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasn t good enough to impress its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap these are supposed to be dead folks anyhows for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick don t come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else s flick and those two involved mattei and fragasso didn t really put there heart and souls into it in fact when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick he doesn t even take it to seriously you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it and that my friends is the last nail on this flick there s no love and no heart put into making this film therefore you get a half assed crappy zombie flick only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made everybody else don t even bother rating 1 out of 5,0
if this movie should be renamed it should be the jackasses of hazzard to sum it up this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 dodge charger around town and in the country chasing the girls and eluding the law i have been a fan of the dukes and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key the overindulgence of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the dukes into trailer trash side from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible the only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 dodge charger named general lee the others have exaggerated the character s role which tarnished the movie the dukes have been another casualty of the 21 st century hollywood television to big screen transition tragedy skip this movie and just buy the television series on dvd my grade f,0
prom night is about a girl named donna brittany snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg 13 horror movies that haven t been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog oh my god and talking about girlish things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but i m still not done with the review the only reason to see prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills if not don t see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24 7 so not only aren t they scary but it s obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of oh my gosh it s our prom i understand it s fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i d be the first one too i m not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously don t spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a night to die for when watching the film 1 star out of 10 p s if i could give the film zero stars i would ,0
i don t care if you d like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isn t good you re so obsessed by the films of hollywood that you can t see how good is this movie i m not a fan of jay chou but i like his play and not only his and may be you think that there is not a big sense in the idea and may be you think it s not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than usa in the world and it s good really good and it cost a lot to do it so please don t criticize the actors the directors cause you don t know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you :) :),1
dean cain the one time super man plays max hooper the super thief he can break into any company and steal any thing for the right price unfortunately his latest heist ends him up in a high rise in which someone else has set a fire to hide their own attempts to steal the product now the thief finds himself having to be the hero rescuing everyone in the building unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the f b i c i a are outside waiting for max the movie is barely passable dean cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material but here he is saddled with a weak script and pretty poor direction ,0
i normally like casper in his movies a real credit to starship troopers but the box cover on this video ssooooo mi sleds the renters at my local video people rent it expecting a perhaps borg like vampire and instead they get a bad re make of lon chaney it had great potential and fell very flat ireally think i could have written a better story line and screen play why is it in every science fiction movie they the cast constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy didn t any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class it is a pet pevee of mine but a solar system is a single star with planets a galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs makes it sound even dumber ,0
pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult who fights them sixteen years later the man has a child with one of the other cultists who during a raid by the police is hidden away and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town it s hard to keep track of who characters are or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place the leader gets paroled sixteen years later i got that from the box i missed the amount of time in the movie nobody is made to look any older not noticeably anyway one murder is done with a large circular logging saw others are done with knives or a crossbow i never heard the title character s name mentioned in the movie but he s the one who overacts the most hooting and hollering the movie is patched together pretty poorly with voice over helping not much to explain what is going on some of the sound effects were pretty bad a man is getting punched and we hear the sound of a whip cracking a woman fires a gun and we don t hear it fire but hear a ricochet instead it doesn t seem to have been done for comical effect ,0
michael played by steven robertson has cerebal palsy and lives a quiet and dull life in carrigmore residential home when a newcomer to the home rory mcavoy befriends him he proceeds to show michael how to live past the disability despite or maybe because of rory s crippling disability unable to move all but his head and a few digits on his hand rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious his affect upon the quiet and reserve michael is spectacular and the two soon leave the care home to set up lives in the outside world where they recruit the help of siobhan romola garai as a care assistant this film is one of the gems of the year much like last year s in america the film goes from being extremely funny to distressing touching upsetting and truly moving without once seeming saccharine sweet knowing exactly where to tug at the heartstrings and where to simply let the story and characters do their thing o donnell has crafted a wonderful film which tells us all to look past the surface and see what lies within the true strengths of the film come in the lead actors so convincing are their characters that you truly do believe that they are disabled to further manage to convey humor and sorrow on top of the already great performances is amazing the pair really seem close friends and as their tale unfolds you care completely for them this is definitely one of the finest examples of film this year telling a very relevant story in a simple way if this film fails to touch your heart then you must contain pure ice inside ,1
wow where to begin with this one well if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers then this one is for you i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at b movie god casper van dien s blunders and boy was this one of them it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever this thing which is supposed to be an indian ghost looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on halloween he dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag complete with what appears to be a bucket shaped bonnet over his head at some points this is a man in costume at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse this monster has the uncanny ability to see with predator vision a clear rip off and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear sometimes the spear cuts people sometimes it doesn t this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow wow this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of critters this creature is impervious to bullets but somehow dies at the end of the movie at the end of his killing spree which we never really find out why he is on he gets blown up this is an incredible feat for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film but i guess this last time was the charm and don t even get me started on the lameness of the other characters first of all what delta force unit employs women last i checked the military still disallows women into combat situations also this unit is undercover why what possible reason would they have to be undercover and they re not even good at it i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn t have on uniforms but they were all carrying machine guns which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film at some points sounding like air rifle bb guns and at others canons there is one part when the skeleton man throws some construction workers from a catwalk and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto at another point michael rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground they tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene then when he is helped back up the hill the rope is flat and when it shows the woman at the top of the hill the rope goes upward from her grip not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill rooker actually has a line that says i m not going after him i going after it what that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard and i watch these bad movies as a hobby the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing production of this film thought that it was so bad ass believe it or not compared to the rest of the dialog this is good the acting bad the makeup really bad these characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face yeah i think i ll make a movie about that attack of the alien scars that move around on your face that villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man and the film would probably be scarier ,0
the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial but still it s carried out fairly well and the story especially the dialogue are interesting they ve taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play perhaps it s a good introduction to shaw s plays the main character raina has her head in the clouds and a flair for the dramatic and helena bonham carter s acting does a good job here her fiancé serges is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure her parents are entertaining enough ,1
this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old manic american to write a story of a moon trip absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d dept but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while save your time and money and watch bolt insteaddamn not enough lines yet i feel that sums it up well i agree with an above review this is like a cold war propaganda story maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing or if the flies had died in the first minute btw why were all the main character flies deformed not one had the full compliment of limbs ,0
this remake is entitled that darn cat but d c the cat is more of a sideline than the major character patti randall was not likable at all in this remake either she reminded me of one of those high school goth jerks you read about who have been angry since the day they were born so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day the federal cop kelso was okay but not as good as the one in the original i guess disney was trying to make christina ricci and doug doug or whatever goofy name he has into stars but they don t hold a candle to hayley mills and dean jones in the original i m an animal lover and a cat lover and i don t blame d c for the remake being so much more inferior to the original movie after all they nearly cut him out of the whole movie all in all a very poor remake ,0
 this review contains a huge spoiler but i don t know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away i saw pinoccio s revenge a while ago now you might think it s just a rip off of child s play indeed there are similarities however chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid it is possible that pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something however the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate the kid is insane and the kid is the one killing people everyone including the audience the survivors and the kid herself thinks it s the doll but it s the kid the nudity is almost a pity because otherwise i could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie ,1
as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont pines yes palms no and the same for the wedding service again nice grove of palm trees when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express did they ship themselves overnight in a crate come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo the two should have switched roles the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time,0
carly pope plays jj a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her jj aghast at this turn of events then blackmails restaurant owner alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother there are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally 2 dimensional jj is a self serving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow jj s colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic the underlying message of an over 50 woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad bad the acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city i would so not recommend this film ,0
well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no ploteven then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold give the demonic 0 10 ,0
hooper is not funny not fasted paced not romantic and non informative there is no real drama you would think that a movie about the world s greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn t seem real no character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time,0
opening with some blatantly reused footage from kit for cat tweety s s o s fails to live up to that classic cartoon instead we get an example of friz freleng s tweety and sylvester series at its most generic unlike chuck jones s road runner series which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting freleng s series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place tweety s s o s then basically amounts to this time let s put em on a boat it s not an entirely weak cartoon there are a few good jokes mostly involving granny s glasses but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off the seasickness routine and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than tweety says i tawt i taw a putty tat a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns tweety s s o s will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it s definitely one to avoid ,0
i am a huge fan of say anything jerry maguire and almost famous i wasn t that big on singles so it s safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron crowe attaches his name to i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably wouldn t like it if i was expecting anything similar to crowe s other films well having just seen it let me say that the former was correct and the latter couldn t have been more wrong it is a very weird movie and nothing really comes together until the end anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory anyway the movie was stellar and i look forward to owning it as soon as the dvd is released i was moved by the film and felt emotionally spent by the end this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion if the viewer allows him herself into the plot in the theatre in which i saw the movie there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot i m sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this i don t mean that to sound pompous but some people are more cut out for the seagal chan van damme genre of movies and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie it is very cerebral so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender as well as much thought afterwards as far as comparing this film to other crowe movies it is very similar in at least one regard in all crowe movies the soundtrack is a character unto itself this is almost definitely due to crowe s longstanding ties to music as anyone who has seen almost famous knows and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruise s acting and crowe s directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire in my mind that is not a bad thing anyway if i had to compare this movie to any one other film i would say this if you enjoyed david fincher s the game you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky ,1
this movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome i just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it the acting was very good hot women and some scary parts it is plain and simply worth the money to pay for ,1
peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work because it shows what a talent peter falk is he doesn t play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it the depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play ,1
the movie starts little cute there are a number of revolting scenes people in toilets good actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here this did not need to be crude forget it find the tv show disney at new low ,0
in 1988 paperhouse was hailed as a thinking man s horror film wow you might say sign me up this thing is a mess it features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2 g headley with a bad british dubbed accent and a story with no chills thrills or spills it isn t even interesting psycho babble one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun 5 the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams what you get isn t good horror art house or even a decent after school special i found myself after the two hour point saying where did my two hours go the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious something interesting it seems like the producers were on lithium even in the dream world things are boring a short no on this one ,0
you get a gift it is exquisitely wrapped the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper handmade and hand painted by the most talented of artists the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace it is a sight to behold then you cut the ribbon rip off the paper open up the box and find nothing that s toys you either enjoy the packaging or forget about it the film isn t without its point and purpose war is a not a good thing well isn t that original the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war war toys in particular are clearly a bad thing until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys it s like someone preaching a stern condescending sermon only to end by saying just kidding but even as an empty box the film fails close scrutiny yes it is a sight to behold with some remarkable striking images the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill but the images are cold and emotionally sterile like the screenplay the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold the film strives to be funny in a morose sort of way but the humor is forced and artificial robin williams as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire tosses in his ad lib shtick which only seems alien to the bizarre coldly structured world he is inhabiting indeed the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be for this film to work or make sense it needs to be set in its own universe an oz far removed from kansas every time the jokes jerk us back into reality the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham it is said that this was director barry levinson s pet project one that he had been striving to get made for ten years it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing like most pet projects that finally get made radioland murders radio flyer battlefield earth being great examples it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker s field of vision perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage he had already perfected it to death many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy mechanical wind up monstrosities so is the film itself ,0
i ve seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst definately bottom 100 material imo that is we follow two couples the dodds billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene and the kirkendalls patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy in one car on a roadtrip to reno apparently lonnie isn t too happy with his sex life so he cheats on his wife with candy who s despirately trying to have a baby roy meanwhile isn t too sure if his sperm is ok so he s getting it checked by a doctor now i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend didn t and she blurted out after about 20 minutes oh yeah she s gonna end up pregnant but her husband can t have any baby s spot on as this movie is soooo predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terrible an example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada when they are stopped by 2 police officers as they didn t stop at a stop sign the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes it s just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewhere i still have to puke thinking about the ending though apparently roy isn t having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after yuck best scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why couldn t they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes one would expect more from this cast although thornton really tries but you can t really blame them writers shame on you 1 10 ,0
bad personal opinion the folks who made it they knew that when they made it to star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three criteria 1 you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way 2 you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards note that i didn t say you had to do it well saves on time and paper work 3 you had to be willing to get naked gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales want to watch a better movie easy get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself trust me you won t do any worse as vampire movies go well this one sucks and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies consider the link between vampires and crosses now take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in ed wood couldn t have planned that kind of an accident any better himself ,0
star rating jodie marsh michelle marsh kym marsh rodney marsh hackney marsh harlan banks steven seagal not quite as bad an actor as kevin costner but aaaaahhhh you get it is a modern day robin hood listen close you can hear brian adams music playing in the background no not really the kind of guy who steals ill gotten blood money from drug dealers and uses it to keep run down orphanages open but now he s been approached to drive a getaway van in a heist from las vegas in one of those last things before retirement type jobs but of course it all goes wrong and he winds up the patsy for the big guys at the top and in jail here he meets a guy named although you wouldn t know it from paying attention to the movie ice cool treach who he forms a friendship with and ends up breaking out of jail with once free he s out to prove his innocence locate the missing money and naturally get even with those who framed him of all seagal s recent straight to video films today you die has that look about it most of all that it belongs in a cinema even with a rap star as his co star like his previous cinema films half past dead and exit wounds yes it seems when he s not making films about looking after the environment he s pretending to be black and co starring with rappers but tyd is not a cinema film and that s a luxury the great one is never going to be enjoying again until under siege 3 materializes if ever the film opens with a slick polished look that commands attention but it all quickly goes down hill from there once seagal hits prison the plot quickly loses it s coherence indeed treach s character just seems to pop up out of nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in it that s it i know i ve said it before but i think i mean it this time i don t think i m going to be giving any more of these straight to video seagal films any time i honestly have no enthusiasm to watching shadow man at all in fact i can honestly say that i ve not really enjoyed any of his stv films up to this point and today you die is certainly no exception an apathetic boring effort all round best avoided by all ,0
 the belief in the big other as an invisible power structure which exists in the real is the most succinct definition of paranoia slavoj zizek this is a review of marathon man and the falcon and the snowman two films by director john schlesinger though hitchcock and lang brought the conspiracy thriller to hollywood the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s with films like the parallax view z marathon man capricorn one the manchurian candidate three days of the condor and all the president s men this was the age of vietnam and watergate the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders the genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s until the x files tv series sprung to life with taglines such as the truth is out there and trust no one the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes the only way out of the maze fight the future as the tagline of the series final season proclaimed it was apparently our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information discovering some elusive truth that ensured our own freedom this trend ended with the boom of the internet conspiracy thrillers now giving way to conspiracy documentaries the internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as loose change and zeitgeist whilst in the mainstream michael moore titillated his audience with stuff like fahrenheit 9 11 all these documentaries believed in a secret order a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world they struggle to create a mono myth linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everything this need to streamline narratives to make them more efficient is reflected in the scientific community who battle to create a grand unification theory and ultimately a theory of everything merging everything from quantum mechanics to special relativity into one giant all encompassing formula so ultimately the conspiracy thriller is rooted in man s desire to have control the modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official institutions yet at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies an unseen other pulling the strings this apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big other its disappearance causes us to construct an other of the other conspiracy in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes conversely there is no need to take the big other seriously if we believe in an other of the other we re therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures man thus seeks to assert control over a wayward universe to create a kind of paternal babysitter be it god a mathematical formula a conspiracy theory an explanation for violence conspiracies murder war etc who provides meaning and symbolic order the big other provides reassurances to the believer it s a lifestyle choice akin to religion in which his place in the world is dependent on sheer irrationality the problem with most conspiracy thrillers from the innocent days of hitchcock s topaz all the way up to modern fare like the da vinci code are two fold firstly they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is wrong amongst the elite or best people but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social collective and systemic an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures secondly and most importantly these conspiracies ignore the fact that the big other simply doesn t exist there is no symbolic order pulling the strings some modern conspiracy thrillers eyes wide shut existenz etc acknowledge this with their untangleable webs of lies accidents truths and half truths nothing ever adding up nothing ever making sense the real and the hyperreal the truth and the desire all blurred without any identifiable ground zero but these are mostly films by intellectual directors compared to these modern conspiracy thrillers marathon man and the falcon and the snowman are positively archaic marathon man is a about a grad student dustin hoffman who gets embroiled in his big brother s business roy scheider which unfortunately has to do with spies guns double agents diamonds and evil nazi dentists scheider is suave hoffman is excellent and schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals the reveal of the eiffel tower is stunning but what s most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines don t intersect until the 1 hour mark even then it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense unfortunately the film ends with a clichéd showdown between the villain and the good guy everything neatly resolved and explained the falcon and the snowman is a bit more ambitious sean penn and timothy hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the soviet union hutton works at a civil defence contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of penn a small time drug dealer who has no qualms selling to the kgb penn does this strictly for the money whilst hutton is disillusioned with the american government particularly its attempt to depose the leader of australia and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and games of espionage in other words the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies marathon man 7 9 10 the falcon and the snowman 8 10 aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clichéd ending marathon man is an effective thriller with several neat scenes the falcon and the snowman is even better penn turning in a memorable performance ,1

this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here it s a pretty film with nice visuals featuring the scenic beauty of hawaii however that was the only redeeming quality for me the story was generally boring who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her picture husband is a lot older than he advertised he was granted that could be a bummer but get over it only in the last 10 minutes does she do an about face and become fond of him by then for most viewers it was too little too late we d fallen asleep by then ,0
luc besson s first work is also his first foray in science fiction a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with the fifth element 1997 even if this film was strongly influenced by hollywood cinema it is still highly enjoyable back in 1983 le dernier combat reveals besson s own approach of science fiction he takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work shot in widescreen and black and white a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can t talk any more some barbarian hordes were formed in parallel a man pierre jolivet lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable paris where he is received by a doctor jean bouise there are no words in besson s work the characters actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving the film has never the look of a despondent one it seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster the film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time it s all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times following this reasoning one could argue that the bearded giant jean reno embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film the pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn t really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope personally the film could have gained with no music at all except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder luc besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one he also boosted pierre jolivet s career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future force majeure 1989 simple mortel 1991 ma petite entreprise 1999 or filles uniques 2003 ,1
lily mars a smalltown girl living in indiana dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show lily follows unknown to john of course and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the show s leading lady isabel rekay jealous when isabel gets fed up with the john lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and john decides to make lily the star isabel returns later and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance very charming film and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role her reading of lady macbeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career i enjoyed heflin s character thornway more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren t assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film rating 7 ,1
a real classic ten out of ten every actor is perfect the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking wonder if this film is already out in dvd because it must be seen in widescreen version saw this film in the late fifties maybe three or four times and never since then forgot it i remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features process called warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their performances the only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like say nicholas ray to increase its rhythm and tension ,1
eugene o neill s 4 and a half hour 1927 play brought to the screen in less than two hours the play s combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn t aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it especially norma shearer s nina and ralph morgan s marsden clark gable as ned darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits gable s range once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable the technique used here for the asides is another problem on stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience here they re done as voiceovers you d think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts plus it s difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of groucho marx s hilarious parody version in animal crackers added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons nina s promiscuity is soft peddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play and a wretched score uncredited that sounds like background music to a turn of the century weepie o neill called this film a dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship and although strange interlude is nowhere near as great as his later the iceman cometh and long day s journey into night it certainly deserved better than this ,0
rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real it s almost hard to remember that it s only a movie this is by far madeline stowe and alan rickman s performance of their careers the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit the only bad thing about this movie is that it s very difficult to get a copy of it i have yet to see it other than on laserdisc this truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on dvd it really is that good ,1
this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere subplots come in and out of nowhere the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer s motivation is unclear to say the least maybe they could get away with this in a porn version but here some more clarification is needed ,0
there is just one word for this film appalling the director clearly has talent but like his character robert carmichael he throws it all away carmichael has potential but like cray he can t be bothered to use it being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is cray s vision of british youth like the british tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect cray cries out for attention but deserves none i was appalled by the act of violence that cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience he assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee some actors of quality have small parts in this film danny dyer and leslie manville both make short appearances the acting is otherwise amateur the young men joe and ben are cringe making carmichael played by daniel spencer is creepy miranda wilson plays monica the attractive wife of celeb chef jonathon michael howe how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief the film is never subtle and monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action war imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves that acts of violence will occur within even civilised countries this is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position but cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images the female characters in the film offer no relief they are either victims or in manville s case a washed out mother the community is represented as dysfunctional this is cray s first film i listened to what he had to say during a q and a session at edinburugh and he is not unintelligent he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety the film is due to be released later this year but i hope the company goes bust cos the public really don t need this kind of messed up material ,0

my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through my own father spent some time in changi before going onto the thailand burma railway in f force much as been said about the treatment the pow s received i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when singapore fell at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs no show could truly convey what the pow s went through but this comes closer than most as the ex pow s say if you didn t have mates you didn t survive this show succeeds in getting this message across ,1
joseph conrad s timeless novel heart of darkness was depicted in the 1994 movie i have read conrad s novel and i must say even though i prefer the novel itself the movie was a great depiction the set and costume designs brought conrad s novel to life on the screen as we followed marlow s journey the acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms voices and personalities if you have read the novel i recommend that you also view this movie if you have not read the novel however the movie may be harder to follow conrad s heart of darkness is too full of action emotion and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long therefore if you have not read the novel the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow overall i gave this movie a seven out of ten the basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets costumes and acting nothing can replace joseph conrad s original work however ,1

i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real talk about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination there s also the bad acting bad writing and bad special effects they are just all around terrible terrible movies yes believable and horrifying to a kid but i can t imagine a grown up buying into this shlock although i must say that i would be interested in seeing them today as an adult they might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them ,0
a magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend christmas with her after a slow start it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast in a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in double indemnity stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while greenstreet is well cast as the publisher however sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the english language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible european accent ,1
the sopranos 1999 2007 number 1 television show of all time everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn t go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving upper middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters lives which makes the whole thing more interesting credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning television s most complex and enigmatic character simply exceptional 10 10,1
a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dante s inferno there is nothing especially clever dante s divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and or religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door it s really a shame that the entire film couldn t have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun ,0
one of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the tories or british american loyalists are portrayed and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for king george iii in many ways the american revolution was definitely a family affair in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it if there is a strong criticism to be made of this film it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life in some regards the actions of the character of major boulton played by cornel wilde make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline he seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of anything for the cause fellow this film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social norm in that day and age in its subtext the fact that about twenty five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro british is glossed over too but the strength of the tory element is not obviously maligned although the good doctor character is about eighty five percent upper class twit to steal a fine phrase from monty python s flying circus anne francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script and it stands out she was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties a gal who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed if there had not been a life and death struggle going on one good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the american revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort all in all the leading characters are very well drawn the minor characters are not just human props and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action this is a great spy movie it s not quite a great historical drama but it does satisfy well enough it rates a seven largely because cornel wilde is so deeply immersed in his role and does it so well and because anne francis makes the most of her supporting effort the color print used on turner classic movies was very clear as well and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard hope it runs again soon ,1
i paid one dollar for this dvd and at first i was feeling ripped off but then i started thinking about it and i should be grateful i have found a holy grail a real touchstone of bad cinema if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with evel s awkward camera address monologue then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeur s butt the script seems to be pasted together from press clippings and esl textbooks but i just can t believe how bad george hamilton is he seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says the only internal monologue i can detect is gosh i bet they think i am cute really cute this is an epiphany i now know how bad it can get ,0
the dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors huppert and dutronc and the horrible script evidently the actors lost since the director screenwriter claude chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter fortunately the powerful performances by huppert and dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie which miraculously gains the depth and humor as for chabrol s persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical it reaches the climax in the final scene which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it ,0
when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but who s that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless it s a campy sort of film that s a joy to watch there s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts i ve watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn t the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight ,1
the forest isn t just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip a cave dwelling cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them there is something you don t see every slasher director don jones gets an a for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman michael brody aka gary kent the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife s lover the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn t work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10,0
just read the original story which is written by pu in 18th century strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty ,1
 okay maybe not all of it lured by the false promise of bikini clad women on the movie s cover but the horror the horror whatever you do do not watch this movie gouge out your eyes repeatedly bash your skull in do what it takes never again never forget ,0
while it s early to say how the series will evolve i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be there is still potential for the series however of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential too but was sorely disappointed my gut tells me enterprise won t be as bad as voyager however as for the impressions of the pilot the pilot had some good ideas and good themes i liked the introduction the show s opening credits were interesting with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the feel of setting out on a grand adventure the plot of the episode itself was more a generic trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space merely subplot and subtext were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise tos or tng the central plot didn t reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the action instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration they could have been the story get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it oh for a tv show that once again would make us think make us feel the excitement of the wind and being on the sea instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay there was way too much gunplay we had the feeling more that humans were the freshmen in an established school new kids on the block as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe sadly the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological just how do two such different societies interact don t just hint about it show it i had to think of it more as trek with an akward crew and limited technology as opposed to the first brave steps into the unknown i wanted to see something newer and fresher the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven t seen this new great concept i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential there are some interesting characters bakula is wonderful blalock has potential the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11 if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme we will have a show which will create new legends you shoot an arrow into the air good luck capt archer to the producers take more risks and make us think :),0
i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time she can act but doesn t get a chance in this clunker the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape the production values make _blair witch_ look professional there s a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not amusingly so the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes ,0
this stupid anti environment wannabe jaws is sad pathetic boring poorly dubbed and stupid there is nothing redeeming about it plot follows some shark octopus creature thingy that appears off the coast of florida and kills some people including a boring stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason his ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague sideshot of something bumpy over and over it makes no sense it s horribly boring and it s conspiracy plot sucks there are moments of camp that cannot be ignored the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence three times the doctor slamming a dying patient s chest twenty times with a difibulator without stopping even though he s clearly dead the porno esque soundtrack the shot of the couple making love on the beach with three different thems that us is getting ahead of us doing this the ancient computer that sounds like kermit the frog a beer guzzling scientist screaming i know a la dr smith the list goes on and on oh and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie much noticed by mike and the bots the mst3k version is their best episode but it s certainly better than the movie itself this is how i like to go fishing guys with a flashlight and a flamethrower crowone star for devil fish seven for the mst3k version,0
this thing is horrible the ben affleck character is self centered and gleefully sadistic punch you in the nose fratboy sadistic and he s the romantic hero his cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness if i were a socialist i would screed beyond belief but i m not a socialist we capitalists like a little christmas magic from time to time this ain t magic i don t know what it is it s just awful and it s a horrible waste of talent o hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late 70s gandolfini applegate these people were all underused if ben was out of the equation these folks might have dreamed up something excellent ,0
we don t have to lose this movie this is one of the greatest i have ever seen jean pierre leaud is amazing more than usual and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue jean eustache is no more on this earth we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors you just have to love this masterpiece i ll never forget it p s sorry for the english ,1
you could say that the actors will make a movie but this clearly proves that statement wrong most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways the story is very simple it could be summed up in a few words but i ll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater i d have to say that 70 of this film revolved around cooking eating or getting ready to eat quite frankly i d rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth personally i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too outside of my own personal dementia the film really lacked anything worth it s time there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging when something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry best not to look this one up ,0
i m sorry but i don t understand how the studio get s away with this the movie is just not worth it maybe as a theater play but certainly not as a movie and why do they call it a thriller offcource the acting is good but i did n t expect anything less from these perfect actors robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the softy bad guy helen mirren can play almost any role and always still looks beautiful to me i m also a fan of her british detectives still they just can t save this ow so boring movie i m sorry i hope we don t get to many movies anymore from this director pieter jan brugge cause he obviously doesn t now the meaning of the words suspence and thriller ;),0
this is one of the funnier films i ve seen it had it s crude moments but they were full of charm it s altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell s nipple i truly was surprisingly this is a good natured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve carell s friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty year old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended ,1
i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive in theatre here in toronto it s about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college so they start up their own and of course call it h o t s it s a fun movie that is just bursting with drive in nostalgia lots of fully endowed t shirts vans fighting and a football game showdown like no other it s been compared to animal house which is a good movie in it s own right but to me nothing compares to h o t s it has it s own brand of fun character if you are looking for a classic t n a movie look no further because the h o t s girls are to the rescue boom boom shorts all ,1
love is overwhelming in all it s manifestations gorgeous absolutely gorgeous tudor chirila maria popistasu and ioana barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all it s shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love truly remarkable is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect this is a brilliant film two thumbs up to everybody involved ,1
i gave it a 2 just because natassia malthe as the vampiress quintana looks sooooo sexy in this movie certainly there is very little logic to this movie but so are most of the sci fi vampire flicks the movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories unfortunately it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable but ridiculous there is too much gore and too many rip off the body scenes that made me feel sick a good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don t need to see a lot of blood we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he she is going to do what a vampire will do a few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene like the one at end when quintana tries to sexually arouse rosa all it needs is a few moans the rest is your imagination anyway it s just my personal taste ,0
i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007 s films if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as 3 10 to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows you re dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller it s one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly masterson s screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay but the film has much more going for it than just it s delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top notch combining the sizzling drama thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell the screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the film s dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it s watching actors and then there s albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they re middle aged men and yet despite this it is clear how finney s father favours hawke s younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters wives of the brothers also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go by this film isn t revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and it s very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson s brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing first time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years ,1
first of all no one with any law enforcement experience not er or emt but real law enforcement takes this show seriously walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics on top of that he is a comic book character no acting ability incredibly trite lines no character development the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are and trivett is the ultimate clown in black face come on if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias then explain why jt is treated as a dolt always is the subject of walker s jokes never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime and never rescues walker who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me most cops are dumber than dirt the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured the jerk needs to be put of his misery but then again norris produced the show as well as starred in it so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time what a terrible series it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger roy rogers the cisco kid and wild bill hickock though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows but like those shows in the same way as those shows walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly ,0
i knew nothing about this film until i watched it my brother in fact suggested i take a look normally his suggestions aren t much cop however but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched it well to cut a long story short i give it 10 10 the film centers around two people that meet whilst lodging at the same place one is initially very dependant upon the institution around him the other is a rebel one does what he likes the other as he s told from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building and see how they rub off a little on each other it s a remarkable piece of work that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist people leaping out of bath tubs or superheros coming to save the day there s a fair amount of grit and reality in there not everything can ever go just right not all gulfs can ever be spanned and this film delightfully shows the lot if you watch this film and are not impressed i d suggest that you don t watch anything again ,1
ok let me say that i didn t expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold all i asked for was it to be cinematic and it wasn t even that it looked like someone s bad home movies poorly acted scripted and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people i ve ever seen the film s plot focuses on a low class family who decide to go on the jerry farrelly show to discuss multiple affairs between a mother daughter stepfather and the daughter s fiancee from there the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience white trash pornography there s redneck sex interacial sex even sex between jerry and his wife yuk this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision at least it was mercifully short disgusting and degrading african americans and working class america should be offended howard stern should be pleased however he didn t squander his attempt for film stardom his was smart funny and entertaining my grade f the daughter was hot ,0
this movie deserves the 10 i m giving it but it s not the 10 that you d give to movies like the godfather or goodfellas or psycho this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh over and over again it s the most horribly written and directed movie yet it doesn t fail to entertain it has the most amateur effects yet you enjoy every moment i saw this movie today on tv and i didn t want to move away read the following dialogue to know why whole college is standing around manisha who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness bad guy 1 please forgive us bad guy 2 yes we won t do it again no response from manisha akshay come on forgive them manisha i don t know akshay you are a beautiful woman and even dead men can get aroused by you and these are living young males don t blame them pancholi yeah manisha manisha to suniel what if they tried to rape your girlfriend suniel i d break their hands legs and kill them but anyways just forgive them akshay yeah if you don t forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue this movie never fails to entertain mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations the bad guy munish can do basically anything he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again every actor takes turns to speak one line from akshay then from suniel then from arshad then aftab then nigam it s the main rule followed by the director so that equal screen time is given to each guy and then there s the all powerful pendant which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed all these things make it an enjoyable movie and i can watch it over and over again i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one the only problem is that it wasn t trying to be funny ,1
serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction known as chapter plays they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called chapters or episodes each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week the serial would end with a cliffhanger as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape the audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again serials were especially popular with children and for many children in the first half of the 20th century a typical saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial along with animated cartoons newsreels and two feature films the golden age for serials was 1936 1945 this was one of the best of the era zorro has been seen in many films but reed hadley racket squad the undying brain was excellent in the role the action is constant and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer zorro triumphs as he always does ,1
well what s to say the golden child falls in the category so bad it s good eddie murphy is having some funny and sometimes quite annoying lines but you are still entertained chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa what a f ed up name is this who should watch the golden child hm difficult to say but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog 4 out of 10,0
i remember that show i still remember that kick ass fun song america s funniest people frankly it should ve been titled american s lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people dave couldn t save this show and neither could bob saget or the replacement hosts for afv that came later the jackalope segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than bob s but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the olson twins plus afv was in it s prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame but still the theme song rocks ,0
ok so the fx are not high budget but this story is based on actual events not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors even richer as most movies that are based on books there are somethings that just don t fit only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events not a knock off as most people believe it is this movie is in no way related too twister other than both movies are about tornadoes for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie there are a couple of things you need to remember the actual night of the twisters was june 3 1980 so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events try think how far storm research has advanced in that time it happened in a larger town grand island nebraska is the third largest city in the state even though the movie calls the town something else and says it s a small town for the real story check out http www gitwisters com ,1
you know this movie reminded me so much of so many people i know i think that s the reason why i loved this movie so much i was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it but the dialog is so hilarious that you can t help but have a good time basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously it turns out the owners are just as insane megan one of the dog owners goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog there is another couple that is just great gerry and cookie this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable in the beginning of the movie gerry describes how many boyfriends cookie had throughout the movie her lovers see her and hit on her even in front of gerry it was just great and fun to watch gerry s looks this whole movie is just a hoot and you can t stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up it s a great movie is just fun to watch i d highly recommend it now i have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves d 8 10:D,1
this is an excellent movie as a canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar the winter canoeing trapping hunting and the like it is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me the story of grey owl is well known to many canadians credit to director attenborough and screenplay writer nicholson for expanding the story brosnan does well portraying a complex man a very fine performance annie galipeau is lovely in her first large role the rest of the cast is solid ,1
nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc but the heat is on and he can t find a secure location he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can t make a prim missionary sarah brown go out to dinner with him sky takes up the challenge but both men have some surprises in store this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour with big sets loud music larger than life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing which i don t my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music i like all kinds of music from albinoni to zz top but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending pah pah tah dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren t my cup of tea this was written by the tag team of frank loesser mankiewicz jo swerling and abe burrows based on a couple of damon runyon stories and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak blaine s two numbers for example are identical unnecessary don t advance the plot and grate on the ears and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you there are only two memorable tunes luck be a lady sung by brando not sinatra as you might expect and sit down you re rockin the boat nicely performed by kaye but you have to sit through two hours to get to them the movie s trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful laid back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise bustle and vowel murdering of noo yawk fans of musicals may dig this but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show ,0
i remember when this nbc mini series aired when i was in high school after reading the novel i thought i d check out some adaptations didn t expect much out of a tv mini series but now i might have to check out some more this is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made writer simon moore who wrote the teleplay for the original traffic mini series upon which the soderberg film was based came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly he frames gulliver s adventures as flashbacks with the actual story beginning as gulliver first returns home everything having happened on one journey gulliver played by cheers ted danson is sort of crazy seeming when his wife mary steenburgen welcomes him back into his home unfortunately the house is now owned by the local doctor james fox who has designs on steenburgen gulliver seems merely disturbed at first but when he starts telling stories of tiny people that s all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum all four of gulliver s travels are related in this version in the same order as the novel the only time this has been done on film i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks gulliver s small son whom he has never met before reminds him of the lilliputians the doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the brogdingnagians and the doctors scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the laputans and the professors at the academy finally when he is put on trial he is reminded of the houyhnhnms and the yahoos the cast of this thing is amazing and includes peter o toole ned beatty alfre woodard john gielgud kristin scott thomas omar sharif and warwick davis the biggest flaw of the mini series is that the acting is really uneven you have all these fine actors but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of l a law but don t do well in a costume drama ted danson isn t especially great although he has a few sequences where he excels it s probably better that he didn t attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent steenburgen is actually pretty good at it and is quite good overall another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly it s not believable that gulliver spent eight years away from home as is claimed but in general it captures swift s tone and purpose very well while with its structure adding a new emotional level ,1
the japanese cyber punk films have never really done a whole lot for me but of the handful that i ve seen most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining meatball machine is no exception the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts takes control of their bodies turns them into necroborgs and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other apparently as a game for the enjoyment of said parasites the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other but whose love affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites and are forced to fight each other it becomes a test of human will vs the parasite s control over their physical bodies meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo as most cyber punk films are and for good reason there are definitely some thematic parallels though the films are definitely different there s plenty of fun splattery moments in meatball machine and the creature borg fx are definitely the high point a mixture of tetsuo meets gwar that are both elaborate and inventive depending on your taste for these types of films meatball machine may or may not be your thing if you enjoy hyper kinetic cyber punk films with a healthy dose of splatter this one s for you 7 10,1
some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death i personally think that this movie is a disgust which should have never been released this movie is repulsive illogical and meaningless not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose meaning climax and resolution ,0
 the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom jerry s cartoon it features the usual cat mouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse him as much as it is weird it s also very cool and funny to see what we can t see jerry invisible it s amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who s doing it we know who right it s like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts it s equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he s invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when he s not visible some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry s shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks tom s chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too ,1
this movie is just plain terrible poor john savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie he stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club she acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80 s punk rock and one of the olsen twins with purple hair this movie just gets all to crazy with savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head also one of the rare he quotes the elephant man and jimmy durante and i just had to laugh this just gets rediculas and then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth and you can tell that that is all to fake her son doesn t know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity i enjoy a good vampire film believe me i do but i just hated this one even the photography stinks in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of savage chasing the son of corri around till he blinds himself avoid this one ,0
sharpe s honour for the uninitiated is the fifth entry in a series of tv movies focusing on an english army rifleman during the napoleonic wars and based on the books by bernard cornwell which i strongly recommend reading if you were to start by watching this particular one though you d get the impression that sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around should that be the case i d recommend starting with earlier chapters like sharpe s eagle or sharpe s company but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing the story this time is all about the espionage side of things with the french army retreating in disarray from spain major ducos the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round by pinning the murder of a spanish marques on richard sharpe hero of the british army the fragile british spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again when the spanish nobles come to wellington crying for sharpe s blood though the english general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon he s off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot surprisingly enough for a sharpe film as well there s a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way fancy that what this results in of course is a more adventure style approach the concentration is less on the workings of the english military with sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside dodging french patrols hob nobbing with the spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions sergeant harper his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive strangely enough though they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of harper s baby this slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run and should anyone be worried that there won t be the standard battle at the climax fret not because once again the poor old french get a right kicking furthermore ducos makes a fantastic successor to obadiah hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate he is a duplicitous malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of raiders of the lost ark elsewhere hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you d want to deliver your first born even if he does look like a member of iron maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident in short then another strong chapter in the sharpe series sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film it s not the best introduction if you ve not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to sharpe that we don t normally get to witness the action hero rather than the professional soldier and if that s not enough to get you tempted it s also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged sean bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns ,1
after a man turns up dead a soldier becomes the prime suspect undoubtedly the best film to feature three roberts and all of them are in fine form young is the cool headed pipe smoking cop investigating the murder mitchum is the murder suspect s concerned friend and ryan is a hot headed soldier with something to hide grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale future tarzan barker has a bit part as a soldier this film touches on anti semitism a subject also covered in best picture oscar winner gentleman s agreement which was released the same year it is solidly directed by dmytryk who creates an effective film noir atmosphere ,1
this movie is trash from the word go first it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago who cares this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character swearing doesn t bother me but i m still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel the f word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed i rate this on the same level as jaws iv the revenge and everybody wins 2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame ,0
this should be re named everybody loves sebastian the 1983 rural go nowhere town high school junior or senior they seemed to flip flop on that one with weird hair and leo like good looks has a big plate full of issues his step dad announces definite plans to have a sex change operation upon which his mom calls the marriage quits sebastian is called the f word by everyone and their mother all the while kissing around with various girls getting high on ready whip at a supermarket and saving a strawberry prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp sebastian s buddies make eddie haskal look like a choir boy bad association doesn t get much worse sebastian seems to go for harold s suicide attempts record although he won t admit suicidal tendanccies for no apparent reason the genius level sat scoring sebastian must graduate a year early although he has no clue about the future nor does he want to attend college what gives with this nonsense this film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is pretty messed up the final scene suggests that things will be alright although the how is left entirely up to the viewer the makers of this film seem to bank solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male lead the story leaves a lot to be desired looking for what will this gorgeous kid do next doesn t exactly satisfy the lackluster production values just don t measure up to other films independent or otherwise a low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through the results of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans ,0
i know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created sure i m sure i would be a big fan of this show if jeremy clarkson wasn t on it i mean i think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome but jeremy clarkson is just pathetic here are the reasons i hate this man he thinks it s cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours he clearly thinks that he is better than richard hammond and james may he s got my best friend saying pathetic things he screams at kids just for taking a picture of him i m sorry top gear but jeremy clarkson is a freak ,0
i really hope the makers of these movies read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror whether or not this was better than the first doesn t matter cause theyre both just plain terrible i m surprised they didn t learn their lesson from the first movie stop now warning to horror movie watchers dont watch rent or look at the boxes of urban horror films and above all don t buy them ,0
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning ray ray winstone has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie kathy burke who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat meanwhile her mother janet laila morse is aware of ray s son billy charlie creed miles and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way films like nil by mouth highlight this it s a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each copying the other tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough if you pick up a little of what it s about from the off set you can see it doesn t promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn t disappoint in this it s true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars winstone and burke do deliver some great acting we see winstone lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid likewise in a private moment we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase the full impact of the night before kicking in this is another of those films where there s no plot to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next it s been acclaimed by many including the baftas but it really was just too grim and bleak for me i have no right to criticize it for this knowing what i knew about it from the off set but sadly this is how i found it ,0
this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly although fairly popular slapstick californian beach comedy called hardbodies but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right it is certainly better than hardbodies i and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing but except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes venus was underpinned by the legend of the re incarnation of the goddess and summer lovers had the viability of a menage a trois as its theme in my view both these films were much more successful than hardbodies ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi slapstick comedy the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie but few other films have succeeded in the same way and hardbodies ii unfortunately does not there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo comedy they are also grossly overlong so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3 there is little memorable in the acting but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction it is in these latter areas that the failure arises ,0
this was one of the all time best episodes officer sean cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in 68 a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting his case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time while this isn t the type of love i personally support he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn t have been killed for it the sound track was excellent keeps me watching the dvr and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing i shall be watching this one in repeat ,1
bloody birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end i found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget i don t know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly way too over saturated maybe this is a bad transfer to dvd or maybe it always looked like that i don t know there really are no redeeming qualities to speak of there are a few deaths but not really gory i wouldn t bother with it if i was you the best thing about the dvd was the 15 minute interview with producer max rosenberg who was very amusing and honest he didn t have anything good to say about director ed hunt and admits the movie was a failure but he would like to re make it as he believes it has a decent plot however he died in 2004 so i guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge with the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldn t surprise me there s at least one re make per week at the cinema these day it couldn t be any worse than the original i suppose but i couldn t care less whether it got re made or not ,0
 rant start i didn t want to believe them at first but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie gwoemul aka the host of 2006 which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b movie genre successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets mainly spent on special effects have become more and more fantastic do south korean movie makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry has built up since the 1999 break out film shiri swiri by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did rant end the only reason i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean east asian styled dragon i have seen to date for the final scenes now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 dragonheart the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons remember dungeons dragons in 2000 hasn t anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use but how well you use it i hope there are more and better korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one in short i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem arirang being played at the very end as a creature feature i would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it but i ve seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons ,0
i originally saw this movie as a blockbuster vhs rental that was quite some time ago but still remembered it blockbuster doesn t have it anymore netflix didn t have it and there weren t many copies on the web only a few spendy vhs copies recently did finally find it available in dvd form on ebay for a reasonable price in pal format but our dvd player will play pal discs on our ntsc tv wife and i both enjoyed it the style of the movie is a bit strong and many if not most of the parts are rather strongly over played as if amateurs were making it especially the kids but it s not bothersome the contrasts of societies are accentuated in the overplay there is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that the young in russia shouldn t try to escape their not so great life but instead should at least try to make things better first but that s not dominant it s fairly humorous most of the time some downplaying of the west commented upon by others isn t that at all imo i take it as a comment about expectations of the russian characters at least when taken from my western viewpoint perhaps it s a downplay of the west from a russian viewpoint which it is literally by the characters saying it i can t say how literally true to the film the english subtitles are but i can say that the subtitles were done very well full of english idioms as if done by a native english speaker complete with colorful language ,1
where would one start a review of the film snitch d james cahill god rest his soul made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1 and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear cahill s grasp of effects both visual and aural is electrifying the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch d a real gritty like underground thriller also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue yuck i feel the world of film is much less from james passing his memory will linger on and on and on reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production snitch d his insightful director s commentary released a coke hit up the nose of any discerning film goer truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl but i ask you why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap i ll tell you why because thats life in santa ana baby its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle s offices oh no there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children s production of double dragon the play the only qualm i have with this film is that there was never a sequel made come on steven spielberg come on george lucas come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23 how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man james cahill he discovered eva longoria you know oh yeah that he did jonah,1
has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the waiter who is serving when hagarty s wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the waiter laughed at the end i rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter listen closely as the waiter laughs when hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter albeit quickly ,1
there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse the dictionary definition of puerile should now read sex lives of the potato men unless that is you like dog poo and mucous in which case this is the film to see johnny vegas et all what were you thinking ,0
everyone is a genius in something albert einstien was a genius in science william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the chasers war on everything are truly comedy geniuses their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast commission abc after a small start as a satire newspaper the chasers popularity skyrocketed when given their own television show never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for chris taylor going on sunrise a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f k off creating a fake motorcade and driving into apec high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about nicotine by following smokers around yelling out no gary no no gary no while controversial the show is increably funny and worthy of running for years to come ,1
i rated this a 3 the dubbing was as bad as i have seen the plot yuck i m not sure which ruined the movie more jet li is definitely a great martial artist but i ll stick to jackie chan movies until somebody tells me jet s english is up to par ,0
the intricate plot great visuals the world s greatest car chase ever make this movie a lot of fun to watch the beautiful charlize theron adds to the enjoyment the sound score is outstanding add to all this an energetic cast that also seems to be having a lot of fun making the movie ,1
i ve been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn t good at all the play of the actors weren t any better of course shahrukh khan was there yet he wasn t enough to make this movie credible and interesting i ve read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert madame bovary yet for me i didn t see it matching with the indian mentality in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just can t understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of 6 8 10 so it s the kind of movie you should run away ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story ,0
low budget but memorable would be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre vulnerable naive nurse charlotte beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her the lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style as well as a cast of wacky characters the pleasures of this film don t come from the film s shocks which are fairly tame but from the weird atmosphere first we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real there s also an axe murdering judge a shell shocked war veteran and old mrs callahan is like everybody s daffy elderly grandmother gone amok a young patient named allyson gives the term nymphomaniac new meaning a big guy named sam is just a little slow after a botched lobotomy and jennifer vaults suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts the only other sentient person in the place seems to be dr masters but does she have a secret don t look in the basement is a great example of low budget exploitation films there isn t much plot going on but the cheapness works for the movie several cast members turn in memorable performances particularly betty chandler and annabelle weenick and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with you the scene between allyson and the telephone man is a classic for all time and especially delicious are the facial expressions of dr masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical cues really evoking the characters that they accompany my favorite cue is the crazy cue a sitar that twangs whenever one of the patients does something pathological also wonderful is the way that charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax with the patients revealing that dr masters is simply another inmate and then suggesting that charlotte is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her delusions she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact the scene where charlotte manages to finish off the barely alive dr stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low budget horror yes don t look in the basement could very well be the american beauty of grade z trash ,1
the great war breaks out and daddy is a brave pilot who goes off to carry out some unsightly business to put jerry in his place mummy is doing her bit as a nurse so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country where a secret passageway takes them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure based on a book written the best part of a century ago they don t make stories like this anymore and there s a reason the men fly planes and author books the women change bandages and clean house the boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime furloughs the girls do what they are told and play violin badly fat kids who wear specs are nasty all the kids speak in those clipped vowel flattening accents that are soppy and prim but which a certain economic class of english people cultivate on top of the snobbery and yearning for imperial albion there are plot holes a five year old would not tolerate i mean that literally my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset why the compass didn t just drop from his hand as he disappeared the film at least tries to aim strictly for the kids until a completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue by eddie izzard what a waste of genuine comic talent plays over the final credits no doubt the five percent of british schoolkids who go to expensive public schools in the uk will find it all such a jolly wheeze for the other 95 percent of british families who no longer live in the 19th century the good news is wall e ratatouille and wallace and gromit are all out on dvd ,0
i loved the first american graffiti with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock n roll along with being the best teenager flick i ve ever seen the first film spawned the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic star wars before doing the prequels two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws close encounters of the third kind and other films as well somehow without those two the magic died off more american graffiti shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve ron howard and laurie cindy williams are protesting against the vietnam war while their friend terry the toad fields charles martin smith is in the war himself and trying to get out john milner paul le mat is still the hot drag racer in california where he never quite left home the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy clark s debbie terry s girlfriend to the pharaoh s gang members along with harrison ford and others really don t do much the original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock n roll from buddy holly the fleetwoods chuck berry fats domino bill haley and the comets buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music the soundtrack for more american graffiti is a mixture of rock soul country hippie music and whatever fitted the mood during the late 60 s of protesting drugs sacrifices and more after watching more american graffiti it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film with the exception of dreyfuss s character where it wasn t necessary this film wasn t necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects ,0
just came back from the first showing of basic instinct 2 i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy 2 just as much if not more great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking the music is superb reprising the original s theme don t go expecting academy award material go to see it for enjoyment and fun that s what movies are designed for escapism i can t think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was am thinking about going to see it again this weekend go see it ,1
call it manipulative drivel if you will but i fell for it sure there could have been more character development yeah there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant movie of the week score but ed harris was impeccable cuba gooding adorable and touching and let s face it people in real life how many of us really get to know the motivation of others not many we did get a little glimpse into the coach s motivation a very provocative dialog in my opinion not to be soon forgotten so in my opinion this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his comfort zone to reach out to another human being and in the mean time touched the lives hundreds more a lesson we all need to me reminded of why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart you won t be disappointed and bring your kleenex 8 10,1
i am very thankful that the small college town of abingdon va near bristol tn and home of the famous barter theatre where gregory peck once acted managed to get an art film festival togather and show this film there abingdon is two and a hour hours from where i live but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word uzak distant is an amazing brilliant jarring emotional captivating film as a turkish american this film was not only a testimony as to what life in turkey is like but on a larger scale it tells the world of what it is like to be turkish whether one lives in istanbul berlin montreal new york or omaha it may be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes but this is effectively our bob marley song there are so many wonderful scenes in this film it is very difficult to choose just a random few but for me one telling scene takes place in a beyoglu downtown istanbul cinema the title character played by mehmet emin toprak who sadly died in a car accident shortly after this film s completion follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the cinema s main auditorium she goes into see vanilla sky as the image of tom cruise is reflected from a glass we sense that turkish men are competing with tom cruise for their own women s affections even though tom cruise is nowhere to found in beyoglu the scenes shot across the bosphorous shores are also quite revealing as they symbolize the beauty yet desperate empty gulfs which are a painful fact of life in turkey in this film the gulf separates lovers and families a simple empty packet of samsun turkish brand cigarettes and a dying mouse jump off the screen the way seagulls did in the 1982 serif goren yilmaz guney film yol many of guney s films including yol suru the herd 1978 completed by zeki okten and baba the father 1971 have been considered by many to be the best turkish films ever made without guney s sometimes overblown social political anger especially in his last film the 1983 prison drama duvar the wall distance captures the essence of turkish life quite remarkably this is a crowning achievement for a director who in my view can already be proclaimed as the turkish equivalent to directors like tarkovsky bresson and ozu i can t wait to see his other films ,1
this film is sometimes called the story of o pt 2 which tries to pass itself off as a sequel of sorts to the french erotic s m thriller the story of o although i ve never seen the original version i did however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual social politics i guess the o angle comes from the occasional s m overtones which were never as explicit and unpleasant to watch as the ones in mistress klaus kinski is the only recognizable face in this french japanese production but speaks his lines in english at least in the version i saw the unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water it s obvious that after the whole porno chic trend in cinema petered out ouch sorry bad pun about 1975 producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema not to mention foreign art cinema so film goers had to contend with dreck like the last woman and others like it ,0
this is an awesome movie and if you haven t seen it you should go to the video store right now and rent it first off the cast is superb not only does it have current stars like ryan philippe and billy bob thornton but it also has your stars of yesteryear like judge reinhold it also has numerous cameos by actors like jon bon jovi ted danson and jamie lee curtis second off the story was quite good also it was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie and almost made it dramatic it takes the drug situation in the united states and instead of giving it a comedic face like in half baked it has a true life lesson image like traffic so watch this movie if you re a stoner it will give you insight into something you love if you don t do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see ,1
i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie anything will do even stare at the walls is better and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text i tell you also is a low budget movie bad acting no name actors a stupid mutt as the wolf and so on also the story brings nothing new the special effects are made in the 80 s style the movie is almost as bad as the movie megalodon so have fun not watching this movie ;),0
shintarô katsu who played the blind swordsman zatoichi in a total of 27 movies ends the hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost mako midori blind beast the big stick used often in the pursuit of justice is retired forever katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay the usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present along with the blood i m going to miss him ,1
i don t really consider myself a conservative so i wasn t personally offended by this film but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid or both the characters are one dimensional either good freedom loving americans or brainless greedy evil conservatives there s nothing clever or creative just anti conservative i don t really mind the political bias itself but it shouldn t be the only purpose behind the movie and clearly it is on the positive side the cast is wonderful and chris cooper s impression of w is funny the first two or three times but after that it s just the same old joke being told over and over again so if you really hate the conservatives you ll probably enjoy this film but if you re looking for something with realistic characters and a story that s less black and white then you d be better off watching something else ,0
this movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny this movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me i sure enjoyed canning those apricots last night is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy comedy and am totally baffled by these positive reviews ,0
this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated i can t even count how many times i ve seen dirty dancing this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love there is something timeless about this movie i have loved other blockbuster love story movies like pretty woman and when harry met sally i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect the characters the chemistry between swaze and grey the movie s direction the incredible dancing the warm summery atmosphere everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect it is an instant classic and i ve never really seen a movie like it either before or since i don t think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers dirty dancing has a nostalgic languid summery mood realistic characters a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it but i will mention i have no interest in seeing havanna nights this one they should have left alone ,1
as much as i love trains i couldn t stomach this movie the premise that one could steal a locomotive and drive from arkansas to chicago without hitting another train along the way has to be right up there on the impossible plot lines hit board imagine two disgruntled nasa employees stealing the crawler that totes the shuttles to and fro and driving it to new york and you get the idea having said all that it s a nice try wilford brimely is at his quaker oats best and levon helm turns a good performance as his dimwitted but well meaning sidekick bob balaban is suitably wormy as the corporate guy and the little guy takes on goliath story gets another airing ,0
what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres i thought i have to get the other movies this guy larroz has made i was sorry i tracked this down it is a weak attempt at an occult satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere avoid this one too much hype surrounds it not worth the effort of finding it this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres oh and the goat scene was very boring i understand that this is what carries the hype ,0

yokai monsters spook warfare yokai daisenso 2005 a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of folklore it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd like wrist so on these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era comparable to today s halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks ghosts goldfish monsters dancing one headed umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers the fatcheek woman such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls if their design for the movie is a bit simple hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills these rather endearing monsters have to face off destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan disguised himself as a samurai lord despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very poker faced is very charming it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving touching yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf cub white heaven hell 1974 and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best but the yokai are nevertheless great fun the first miike movie which is the most child oriented of his family films with the gozu izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers ,1
those wishing to see film noir remakes should not see this as as a remake you will always be disappointed instead enjoy a gripping performance from dennis quaid and visual imagery to commend the colour drains from the film literally not metaphorically as the plot gathers pace and the dialogue is crisp and gritty the opening dialogue is clever and the viewer is carried along by a sharp screenplay and a real original film noir feel ,1
i absolutely loved this movie it met all expectations and went beyond that i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn t just randomly silly it also had a message jim carrey makes me happy :),1
 voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously the sole administrator of this academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speak sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if you re not interested in the male form stay away burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns the mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days ,0
the secret of kells is a film i ve been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny i m here to tell you now it s been worth the wait the cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as i d feared the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination i particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page the characterisation is superb i love brendan gleeson s voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling the forest is a triumph such a beautiful place the story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book i m a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people i know who ve seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it s a lovely little film i will definitely buy the dvd when it s released and would like to say well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project may there be many more coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas everyone loves it and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars such a joy to see this nominated :),1
this so called movie is horrible the actors cannot act there is no plot i believe they need to start from scratch and film again i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again maybe there is hope for it i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job the wardrobe could have been much better sorry but this just did not do it for me i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but this one i cannot find entertaining i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film ,0
of course i have disappeared into the movies the neil young concert film heart of gold there have been many great concert films through the years the best being martin scorsese s the last waltz which filmed the band s last concert at filmore west a phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two you could change the world as you can guess i felt all five to the bottom of my twenty four year old soul neil young was in the last waltz they had to digitally before digital actually they had to manually scrape a big hanging cocaine rock that extruded from his nose so in the film there s a bright light that is not the star of bethlehem dangling above his lip and below his nostril it s a famous bit of rock and roll history but the last waltz was made when the band and neil and everyone else was in their thirties and heart of gold was filmed last year when neil is in his sixties and his band looks as if they are in their late nineties and the entire movie could visually be used by the christian right and the dea in the same way that those ohio state patrol films of the perils of drunk driving were used when i was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging through front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch close your eyes and it is a terrific concert open them and view dorian grey s hidden portrait case in point the once ethereally beautiful emmylou harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with neil and from dark to light appearing to be a ring wraith leapt full borne out of the river in front of rivendale ghastly ghostlike a nose that doesn t appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery eyes that make buttons on dolls look lifelike and the ability to express any emotion human or not constrained by unrestrained over indulgence in botox my mind reeled porcupine peru jack daniels living hard for decades my god sweet emmylou harris who i saw sing for free at fred s in boulder a face a 2000 year dead pharoah would not accept but the voice as pure as a thick lipped bottle of boulder beer brewed from the waters of boulder creek and i closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrssss an homage one must use homage at least once in any film review to fred s hamburgers on boulder mall and the steve martin pink panther movie it would have been a terrific concert sitting in the dark in ryman auditorium maybe twenty rows back but close up in close ups it was a medieval morality play depicting the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life the concert theme emblazoned on the scenery a prairie wind the last song massed guitars i counted eight and i wondered if irony was at play i don t think so a native american bass player a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like buffalo bill a piano player whose face looked like the screamer s face in munch s the scream the chick singers actually matronly singers mostly reminding one of the lost youth of senior united flight attendants still plying the friendly skies dressed in matching full length distressed denim dresses no it was played straight none of them had seen i would bet a mighty wind it will be a great cd and would be glad to tell tales of hippy dippy boulder when neil was a long haired canadian crooner whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to mirror heartache and loss feelings as universal then as now but only in a dark bar ,0
saxophonist ronnie bowers dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at hollywwod hotel of course at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall lola lane has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia rosemary lane to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it s not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good highlighted by hooray for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive in musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie still the movie isn t that good the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy also there is racism a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there s some truly appalling racist humor at one point that s probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today all in all a so so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7 ,1
to be honest i did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all i can compare to the first part werner beinhart and this one here is really disappointing compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies i watched the last weeks the first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse there are a few good funny scenes but in total it is just another boring second rate try of german film industry that cannot succeed nearly as usual one good thing the movie is quite short 75 min the bad thing it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes don t watch it;),0
it s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by star fleet lieutenant reginald barclay during his holodeck addiction barclay is a recurring star trek character played by dwight schultz dwight schultz is miscast as oppenheimer oppenheimer s character is poorly written so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge instead we see a shallow two dimensional figure from a soap opera paul newman is also miscast as general leslie groves but this movie s problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles the factual errors and great liberties taken with the chronology of events in order to advance screenwriter bruce robinson s political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch that s probably why this movie has found a home on the so called history channel fat man and little boy combine bad science bad history bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the manhattan project ,0
may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids don t really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner may s husband says he doesn t feel well blames it on his daughter s cooking and irritably says he wants to go home he dies that night may now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her days she is depressed and unmotivated she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mother s arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she lets loose with anger over her mother s lack of nurturing may seems disarmed and surprised yet she also doesn t seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i m your mother and i love you what does really say i ve heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are needy though they show it very differently paula has been involved with a friend of her son s darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son nicky but supposedly doesn t live in the home with his wife may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of may s rationalization that what she is doing is okay at a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may s face as she endures the one time ghastly liaison eventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways sympathies will be divided at one point during paula s writing group may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn t like her having any friends so she didn t have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see may s actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother it is a well done film with more complexities than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions it is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeing one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable ,1
this is just as good as the original 101 if not better of course cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella we see a lot more of her this time round i also like ioan gruffudd as kevin the rather bumbling male lead to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea the movie is well worth watching whatever your age provided you like animals ,1
i am a current a s l student was forced to watch this movie in class and what i got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film the film is obviously leaning towards to p o v of the common deaf perception their is no middle ground also the film didn t make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic i e deaf people who were born hearing and later went deaf is it right or wrong in that instance the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w a capital d not that this is bad but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly unbiased ,0
to say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks as the other commenter says this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 it is especially incredibly insulting to gays it is awful and not in a so bad it s funny sort of way either it s just plain awful no i have to say it it stinks sorry skunks from the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for the plot is incoherent the characterization non existent the acting is of the over the top mugging look at me i m being funny school and so it goes on the set pieces are clumsily set up if at all and are badly executed it s just awful on every front apart from the music maybe i don t remember thinking the music stinks apart from the songs to be fair to the makers they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly the opening credits include the title also starring ertha kitt as the voice of betty the meteor since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted ms kitt s contribution from one of her records and the second line of the movie runs something like and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around uranus uranus your anus geddit geddit huh huh your anus the humour really is that cheap it says strange things about the comedies of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say sh t out loud i paid fifty pence about 1 00 for this movie in a sale i feel ripped off ,0
this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his brain dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi plots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long running manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing what s going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man s severed butt cheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell what s going on the dvd of this has director s commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them i m giving this a 8 10 for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this ,1
 when we all know no one does it like the bbc being an avid fan of this sort of sunday night watching i was quite looking forward to this how disappointed was i in the first thirty seconds i didn t think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch however me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters the plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a bbc robin hood style this modern style may have been able to be placed within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous cinematography but unfortunately we got neither the direction felt decidedly sloppy for both acting and shot choice after 30 mins we couldn t bare to watch it and went out and rented the prestige which is very good btw maybe it is unfair that i judge this as i have watched so little of this but rarely have i felt so compelled to warn people not to watch something however me and my friends did think that the house and parasols were pretty but thats as good as it gets ,0

this movie was one of the best i have ever seen just the other day i was reminded of this movie by something on tv it came back to me like a dam flooding over i have never been more touched by a movie than by this one after the movie was over i actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours no movie has ever moved me that way before i was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping i can find a copy to buy so that i can watch it whenever i want to if someone suggests you see this movie with them go you will not be disappointed peggy fries,1
just a regular jason lee movie there were some parts of the movie that were funny the undertone of the move is to live life on the edge i guess these are the types of movies that i think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties it was an all right movie it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention i think that julia stiles and selma blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot its just kind of a boy meets girl movie this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central i am glad that i didn t see this movie in the theater i would have been angry but i guess that s why i didn t see it in the theater ,0
silly comedy casts an embarrassed seeming ray milland as a british officer in world war ii europe escaping german confines and taking up with a man hungry gypsy woman played by marlene dietrich slowly paced overlong and miscast the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder although marlene shines in her solo moments it took three scriptwriters to adapt yolanda foldes book for the screen but this material must have already seemed dated by 1947 it smacks of something ernst lubitsch might have turned out in 1939 the scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together from ,0
never been kissed starring drew barymore as reporter josie gellar is a sweet extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named josie gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school only problem is josie has never been popular high school was in fact a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes josie grabs this assignment as much to finally fit in as to get a scoop what she finds is the major premise of the story never been kissed is one of those movies that s so sappy and schmaltzy at times particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie it is however very sweetly done drew barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely josie she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic i also enjoyed leelee sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends josie on her first day at the school never been kissed has some really funny moments as josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool example the reggae bar scene i also loved the appearance of josie s brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student the way that he helps to give josie her dream of finally fitting in is just hilarious at the same time as josie s woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to josie to be affected by her story drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore josie from the beginning there is a lot of mean girls a 2004 release in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together i liked this movie it was really beautifully done in some areas the movie is corny in some places yes the last scene realistic no way does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way oh yeah yeah yeah baby but it manipulates beautifully there are some lessons to be learned here the movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to josie i ve met people very much like all these characters i think a lot of people simply don t know or can t conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school and how hurtful it can be but it s there not unrealistic at all what struck me was drew s speech at the prom as she demonstrates the sheep mentality that can exist so prevalently as hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be it was well done and very true i m making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture it s engaging sweetly acted and just rufus i d say check it out 8 of 10 ,1

when oh when will someone like anchor bay or blue underground release this on widescreen dvd le orme which i only know because of my rare vintage video collecting habit is a film in my collection that i would not only sit through but actually enjoy watching the fact that klaus kinski is top billed but is only in small parts of the film means little to me though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time i cannot say that this is a good horror film a good mystery a sci fi epic or anything of that nature it is simply unclassifiable in the genre sense of things it is more like a confusing frightening though not particularly violent or bloody dream filled with great visuals and mystery it relies on visuals and emotion much like bava s lisa and the devil both films are beautiful in almost every sense but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner they both occur in such a dream like atmosphere don t be deterred by force video s synopsis on the back cover it is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that though force video s release from 1986 the only one in the us that i know of is cropped to full screen on tape even in that format it is still great releasing it remastered and or letterboxed would make it magnificent hint hint dvd companies ,1
i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunner an american werewolf in london that film had it s funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isn t in the same class but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it s still fun to watch so werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version i ll still give it decent marks since i don t care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too the first 30 40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie delpy i don t see enough of this actress she doesn t seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no f words and no lord s name in vain amazing however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn t appealing to a middle aged guy like me either this film is geared a lot more toward 20 somethings if that helps anyone it s entertaining just don t expect it to live up to the first film ,1
i am a huge robert taylor fan and i have been trying to find all of his films this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s would order a navy lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report only to the president that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film the death row scenes were entirely unmoving the only thing worse than taylor s acting was stanwyck s singing she got better later in ball of fire thank heavens ,0

this movie is retarded a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage thomas hayden church should not direct anymore especially this movie which is a waste of film people who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people on here some are just retarded and don t watch movies so they think that any bad movie is good the actors suck and the movie sucks balls i think that many people are going to be upset because this movie tries to make itself look like the ultimate weed movie when it is just the worst movie about weed that i have ever seen i hope that people will stop the director from directing crap like this even weed cannot make this movie funny or entertaining ,0
i ve only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it i thought it was an intelligent look into schooling friendship bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you re good at it this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere the main character is bad at games seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch i must admit i was gutted by the ending it was powerful and saddening ,1
i would like to know if the outsiders australian tv series will ever be released on dvd sometime in the future and is the music title theme available on cd there was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total the young german actor in the series was also in a german tv series called black forest clinic which aired here in the uk with english dialogue superimposed with the lip sync i look forward to hearing any comments from tv industry personnel on the above questions thank you in advance ,1
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die stanley s killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell brilliant movie ,1
this is fantastic everything from the score to when the final credits role this movie is a masterpiece it s genuinely creepy and its effectively hysterical setting is enough to give anyone the creeps it is apparent that the movie was not rushed and that david schmoeller who would later work with fullmoon on the puppet master series had a clear and concise image of what he is trying to direct the professional aspect of the movie is astonishing considering it s relatively low budget it relies on scares without effects mainly due to budget restrictions but still creates a tension filled atmosphere stephen king stated that this was one of his favorite movies and i seriously cannot blame him it s one of my favorite horror movies and always will be this is my favorite fullmoon movie and has been ever since i first purchased a good few years ago money well spent i own both vhs and dvd versions 10 10,1
i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece ,1
this movie is pretty awful but i have some interesting information about it it was filmed in 1976 at northern arizona university in flagstaff az as well as at oak creek canyon near sedona az a good bulk of the extras in the film are then drama students from nau i was a freshman there that year minoring in theatre but for some reason i didn t get involved with the production i did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact there is a scene in this movie where two of the principals as part of their hazing ritual have to run naked into the woods they are seen from behind in the movie doing just that the thing is those aren t the actors at all but two guys i knew from the theatre department the identity of these stunt posteriors will remain anonymous at least to this website unless they decide to um reveal themselves ,0
well where to begin let s just say this avoid this movie at allcosts it s based on a cartoon series the movie makes the cartoon looklike hamlet filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to behere lousy camera work terrible music and enough product placement tomake you want to never visit yahoo again this movie is really thebottom of the barrel to quote the new yorker matthew broderick andrupert everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandonof men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance they should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it awful ,0
this is not a good movie at all i cannot believe that after fifty years this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored this is a very overrated movie that got very very lucky it was given the national award harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience anyone with even a marginal understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars i cannot understand where to start there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie the topic chosen is great it is important that such movies be made but only by people who are able to handle them sandeep sawant does not measure up to the task not even close his direction is jumpy confused there is no clear thought process he tries but is not able to explore the depth of the characters especially the grandfather he is not able to show the initial horror anxiety and then hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together he is trying to cram in everything without any priorities he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against him however the cast does not help sawant either worst job amruta shubash she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job how did she get tee phulrani extremely lucky and or extremely influential and or extremely pitiful casting having said that she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie her act of the msw should have gone to the more responsible actor sonali kulkarni amruta subhash did not understand it msw s work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm strong exterior as this is reassuring to the patients amruta subhash s asawari seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working for second worst arun nalawade i have never seen a more wooden face in marathi film industry it is abound and everywhere in today s hindi cinema though he is the producer and so he chose himself no second thought no consideration any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producer s to do it but arun nalawade would not let anyone else do it over ambitious and obtuse he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills my choice for this role would be vikram gokhale the music is uninspired the movie is technically lacking it could well have been an ftii project job on the up side brilliant performance by ashwin chitale it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance he put many of today s actors to shame unintentionally maybe but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance also sandeep kulkarni really gave a very believable performance really put in all his efforts and it shows the script too is well written shoestring budget cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie lack of funds dogs all of the marathi movies cricket and hindi movies sponge all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scraps it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out doghi was brilliant movie and it too was made on a shoestring budget doghi also lacked technically but it was well researched and well made it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema why did it not receive the accolades it so very deserved only proves my point of biased judgment lack of research and not of funds is what makes shwaas such a bad movie ,0
the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix a lot of sadness i m sure glad that i wasn t him another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women but i don t think that it was about the women although it was to jfk jr s passion what a shame any loss of life is a real shame seemed like a good account of his life i recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama ,1
living in the middle east in israel i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana having seen the trailer and being a thriller lover i expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle well i almost left the movie in the middle the pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as steve rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don t care save your money save your time choose another movie robi chernitsky,0
i m all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh t how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me if you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it there was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake i ll take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day my partner gave up after about 20 minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one i on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better no such luck i haven t sen his other movie torched and i doubt if i ll bother now ,0
the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments much less hundreds of votes speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization read proust you morons or at least dave barry or calvin and hobbes anthologies chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you d have to have spent minutes nay hours viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service please don t watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells ,0
when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it can t even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it s embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance it s quite easily one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i don t normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie don t miss the making of featurette the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it s a new age citizen kane it s like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think they ve created something of substance it s sad really the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because i think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen but i d have to say that it s somewhere in the bottom fifty ,0
we as a family were so delighted with the last of the blonde bombshells we purchased a copy for our home video library the acting is a1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the music songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the plot as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly laugh and lots of music ,1
this mess starts off with a real tank running over a car intercut with images of a toy tank this is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything the unexplained tank and the untalkative family take up i swear over 10 minutes of film finally the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses and the cops are hiding in the police station interesting almost when the town folk come out due to the family s presence we learn that both the writer and editor are conspiring to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience s inability to tell what s going on will somehow bring unease upon the audience and it works but not in the way they thought it would i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense not in a fun david lynch sort of way but a sort of i walked in during the middle of a boring conversation sort of way over the course of the next hour we learn that the movie makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above mentioned what s going on type scenes the plot involves something along the lines of gentle looking old folks putting children into a trance through the power of satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys and an even more sinister intention and it s up to a group of white men everybody s white in the movie to grab their guns and save the day and a tag a long eye candy woman who whines at the drop of a hat they look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids names this is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of satanism paganism wicca or even catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing from the trinity broadcast network this represents satanism as elderly folks in halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party in front of an ankh replete with a priest spouting completely made up nonsense about satanists while calling them witches the message that anything that isn t protestantism can be all thrown into the same category for easy condemnation about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak a priest studying satanism for 4 minutes with ooh so scary drawings of demons to scare the church lady crowd random shots of dolls random shots of children paint instead of blood at every chance film school level dream sequences introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before they exit sometimes they act as if the nothing that they re doing is a big deal the directing is sloppy at best an example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek looking up they see that it s not blood but droplets from a girl s snowcone snowcones are ice and colored flavored water and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as paint not to mention the fact that her snowcone was a bright reddish orange hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing it then cuts to an alternate shot of the man woman and girl and shows that she s standing about four feet away from them so the snowcone wouldn t have dripped on the woman even if she d held her snowcone out over the woman s face way to go editor of course the acting is blah the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting the director s most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the unblinking eye of the camera leers as the actors make fools of themselves and finally after all that we get to an ending that would ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell ,0
look at the all the positive user comments of this movie then check to see how often each one posts user comments they post once it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro movie comments on imdb this movie was awful the plot was stupid the acting was poor the jokes weren t even funny the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn t funny there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other s back and spreading rumors this isn t even done well every joke is obvious and you see it coming the movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and distributor for 1 5 hrs they stole from me i would ,0
many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients this film follows three friends gary rick and david the big apple misadventures into the world of first time sex and true love along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it s ending if you haven t been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a look sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace l a v truly is an original film a rarity among films of it s genre ,1
this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it i wouldn t say that it is very scary but more fun i guess that is if you like horror movies scarecrow kind of remembered me of children of the corn but still not if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch =),1

disney the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years films like tarzan and the emperor s new groove have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song driven routine of disney s past and into new uncharted territory atlantis is the boldest step yet but we have to remember this is still disney the first ever serious film to come out of disney s animation studio is a major achievement for them in fact it s so serious it makes it into pg territory perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer but despite the more mature subject matter this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with not just mature audiences so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of the little mermaid et al so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96 minute movie ultimately this is an action film about atlantis not about the exposition preceding it so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly you re unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood if you want epic levels of detail in the plot turn to james cameron s titanic both films feature a boat in some manner and let s talk about love shall we yes as with a lot of films the lead male one milo thatch a bumbling archaeologist and lead female kida the clichéd atlantian princess are set to fall in love with each other but what i found was not as clichéd as i was expecting by film s end for once the characters touching feeling kissing sequence was far more subdued there s various points in the film where the attraction grows but it s just not in the ballpark of say the little mermaid a good thing you may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film correct you have your leading hero and heroine backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition all being given their moments during the film numerous other characters appear take up the few minutes of screentime then disappear it doesn t take a genius to do the maths a 96 minute film with a focus on action and visuals and with a considerable cast has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent so what does it rely on clichés and lots of them every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before you have the bumbling scientist the attractive princess the square jawed colonel the rich eccentric the maniacal sleazebag the russian femme fatale need i go on i don t know why this got to anyone i found the tongue in cheek nature of this film quite amusing alright this is meant to be a serious flick but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue and sometimes it even is a little inspired but in the end it s those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake the cgi animation is truly amazing in places and doesn t dwarf the characters which was a flaw that let the recent titan a e down speaking of characters disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs bringing an anime style to the film infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime much more so than any previous disney outing this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime nadia for the film s overall similarities with said cartoon series having not seen this anime i can t comment with picture there is sound gary rydstrom heads up the sound team and what a soundtrack from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score which compliments the film in every way never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended to me the film conveys that it s an adventure thrill ride albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it if you don t like the clichéd tongue in cheek attitude then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight heck at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts cough hercules cough this is a positive 10 out of 10 review from someone who was blown away by this film i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film after all the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium so sit back enjoy the ride and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film ,1
this quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of patagonia hailing from northern ireland via new jersey the main character fergus sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm vitality discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist which adds to the hilarity as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the patagonian outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his er mobile dental unit we never get to meet his wife nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill fated mission but we do get a solid display from lewis fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is gallantly adored by the innocent but sexy 18 year old female lead who tags along on for the ahem ride this film is not for everyone and i can understand why it wasn t pushed by the suits it s a low budget sometimes charming always disarming mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds ,0
bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its 1 movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes it s grotesuque and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i ll be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green eggs and ham they ll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they don t ruin the classic book don t waste time and money by seeing this ,0
okay so maybe the acting wasn t bad but i am typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come the chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer guy and few people other than uninvolved bystanders and the accusee seem to dispute her so what is the point of staying with this drama beats the heck out of me i kept thinking or hoping there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation but none was forthcoming in summary i cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless tv movie based on a true story or not ,0
boring cliched and predictable the only original bit was the brighton location for gangsters it is certainly no lock stock etc hannah was likeable in sliding doors in circus i developed no empathy with his character and couldn t give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise i was so uninterested i didn t even care why the movie was given the name circus booooring don t visit this big top ,0
well this may be one of the worst movies ever but atleast there are some nice t ts in it the movie is a very bad spoof of the blair witch project and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t ts and no point other than to flaunt them ,0
i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it it was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it s got to get better then when it ends you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back ice t did his bad guy thing and well that was the highlight of the evening the pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days all in all i have seen worse but this sure isn t one i d recommend or want to remember ,0
freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns the great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5 dream child i hope i got the number correctly there s been so many and this one is one of the best especially for the cameos by rosanne barr then arnold tom arnold johnny depp who did the very first nightmare in 84 alice cooper singer you will see freddy as a tormented child a teenager who loves pain and as a family guy creepy the effects are very funny and creative the cast also includes lisa zane billy s sister breckin meyer road trip yaphet kotto alien live and let die and amanda donahue father knows best i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d well the ending i love 3d movies i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 i wasn t even born yet the second wave was in 1983 i like all the freddy movies this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s along with jason voorhees chucky micheal myers and leather face can you imagine a film with all of them i recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans alike that freddy is such a cut up 8 out of 10 ,1
i still can t describe what to feel when i received this by the fnac site such a rare movie so little spoken and known is difficult to find even to fans but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating now i hold a dvd of the movie with the finest quality possible as i did in atlantis the other rare besson movie i bought by the internet i saw this one at home with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off and marveled at the experience i didn t know what to expect wickedly i always searched some kind of disappointment when i saw a film by luc besson i never had seen before but it never came this movie was no exception from the start i understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future and so it happened this won several prizes including the highest prize in a film festival of my country which makes me proud and it shows that this movie is preparating many bigger things this may be the most original after the war movie i have ever seen beating mad max in originality and artistic feel there is not a problem with this movie its cinematography is genius as well the perfomances of the actors i am also proud to say that finally i saw all the movies of my favorite director and have a copy of almost all of them joan of arc is still waiting for me to buy the dvd this movie is most of all a work of style and dedication which makes clear why luc besson is a director of my choice good taste beautiful framing excellent use of music i also marveled at eric serra s first feature length score and the promise of great achievements gaumont did well to bet in its boy genius the man who would later change the face of france s and europe s relation between movies and their public let s hope besson starts working in a new directorial project i will be the first to cheer it until then i recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money i loved the atmosphere of the movie which by its black and white cinematography suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust this movie works by the sheer magic of movies showing in pictures what we can t explain by words and i m with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it good choice a great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed ,1
i was lucky enough to see this at this years tribeca film festival i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was director griffin dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly the main story involves the family and it is very thought provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene the film as a whole has credibility and integrity yet still has that commercial edge an indie movie for the masses if you like the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the brightest diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated early days i know but lane acts her socks off here ,1
i watched this last night on sundance altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever this show despite its star power is utterly non compelling and its political insights which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with are shallow and clunky and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today despite the fact it s coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario cuomo the drama as such is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny the only points of interest really are seeing how new yorkers live their lives and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988 sometimes it seems like altman s sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once the effect of which is one feels depressingly like they re a stranger at a wedding ,0
this movie should have been billed as three movie summaries linked together to form a full length feature film including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets be warned the first hour of this movie is simply a re hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character the actual movie doesn t start until the thing is almost over i must say the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious as for the robot i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human the bat s robot consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot body as tom servo put it he s not that impressive he doesn t even have knees that and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room but once he catches you watch out he ll disintegrate you with a touch powered by radium pluh ease this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots otherwise you re just a glutton for abuse ,0
god bless randy quaid his leachorous cousin eddie in vacation and christmas vacation hilariously stole the show he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a look i will say that he tries hard in this made for tv sequel but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really gets anywhere quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets including the orginal audrey dana barron are wasted here even european vacation s eric idle cannot save the show in a brief cameo pathetic and sad actually painful to watch christmas vacation 2 is the worst of the vacation franchise ,0
this movie is a picture perfect action drama and thriller every scene has you sucked in i watched this movie and was amazed by how many talented actors were in the movie damian chapa especially was great he played his role perfectly the story was made for these actors the characters make the movie so realistic this movie very simply gets an a plus from me definitely watch this film it compares with scarface but has a more in depth story this movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life but it also gives you the characters emotions and at the end you really feel for the main character watch this film ,1
if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years my worst fears have come true i have never even in dutch movies seen worse acting i couldn t get myself to watch it for more than 40 minutes so if that s the cause of me missing the genius so be it ,0
in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe i can t see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who s afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn t always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens ,0
oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie i have ever seen the acting is bad the story is weak the characters are weaker and the whole film just doesn t make sense couple this with mediocre directing really strange scenes such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in and thoroughly abysmal dialog look musta peed his pants and you get one complete failure not to mention the fact that the only thing mr atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars but this is part of the movie s charm sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh i love this movie because it s just so bad ,0
it s been a long time since such an original quite funny black comedy has surfaced if eating raoul is on your top 100 list do yourself a favor and find undertaking betty immediately the subject of death being funny has been attempted before see paul bartel and mary woronov in mortuary academy while that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy undertaking betty is much more steady with a better cast who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original uplifting and heartfelt comedy i was surprised and you will be too i highly recommend seeing undertaking betty merk,1
jim henson s muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood this film makes me feel like a kid again okay the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch anyway the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city it s worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself ,1
it s amazing that so many people that i know haven t seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie i ve never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie s slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that s the only flaw i could find in this cult classic if you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated director s cut for the best viewing option rating 9,1
all credit to writer director gilles mimouni who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal while keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arm s length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on even his clever denouement has you guessing the three central performances are also top class with vincent cassel romane bohringer and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery jean phillippe ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair thierry arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and cardine biggerstaff s editing keeps the story a step ahead of us the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script many may say gilles mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love for me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web only the french are capable of such tantalisation hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending monday march 2 1998 hoyts croydonno one does thriller quite like the french when they get it right they really get it right vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max romane bohringer obsessive as the new lisa and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa the plot from gilles mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads as lucien jean phillippe ecoffey is strong and emotional friday january 15 1999 video,1
i don t remember this film getting a cinema release over here i only saw it when it came onto cable the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an off world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space and would have been happy if it was i m certainly happy it was nt kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple the scene where he s sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slow mo replays detracts from the moment this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner alien silent running logan s run or thx1138 were however it is unfortunately the nearest i ve seen to it in a long time he changes in the movie to a believable degree he does nt crack arnie one liners he does nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending that s why this film did nt do well it did nt follow formula and among a 18 25 year old target american audience that s unforgivable as it was was nt what they expected to see fear and discipline always ,1
true fans of film will love this authentic movie i disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one star and calling it unrealistic while i don t have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists i ve spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave i don t know what the basis is for others comments that the film is unrealistic the dialog is great the low budget production value didn t bother me a bit i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama i completely bought into the character s motivations and reactions the acting was believable and impressive for new and non actors if your idea of good film is transformers or fast furious then skip it if you enjoy good character driven dramas then see it regarding the negative commenters being trolls click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews ,1
i rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend s place and it was an instant success the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70 s australian twist the acting isn t exactly shakespeare society stuff here but later mad max star bruce spence is a beautifully understated surfie scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by gary wadell and robin ramsay as a deliciously 70 s camp fairy godmother father character also note the musical contribution from ex daddy cool frontman ross wilson on the title song in a similar vein to later day aussie comedies such as priscilla queen of the desert good fun ,1
this was the best muppet movie i ve seen ever i happen to know that miss piggy s fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of muppet babies the songs will remain in my head forever only saying so because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head sorry a little off the topic there but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye hasta luego that made me laugh so hard my absolute favorite is the play at the end i was surprised that the sesame street characters popped in at the wedding i m just glad this movie was very entertaining i borrowed it from the library and now i have bought it because i can t keep the library s copy forever in conclusion i proclaim this is the best movie i ve ever seen in my case it s even better than austin powers in goldmember which was my favorite movie ,1
oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society it s just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the viewer s throat also a point to would be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity if anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don t seriously please you have better things to do ,0
please make me forget please please this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences what a load of garbage and don t get me started about the acting someone please help me forget weird science come back everything is forgiven i am proud to give this film the first 1 here at imdb and i ve voted for hundreds of films many of them c p but this is so bad i can t even believe it someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film someone read the script and auditioned for it someone saw the film and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity these are the questions i want answers to not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well you know ,0
first i have to say that i have read everything about this subject and i know it inside out and i was excited about finally seeing it too but you have to read only the book this mini series is based on to realize that it s not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago it s loosely based on the facts the rest is taken from the scriptwriter s imagination and unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary where do i begin vita and violet didn t use the names mitya and lushka until their affair started and during it violet also called vita dmitri and julian it was violet who chased vita with a dagger when they were teenagers the seduction scene when their affair started violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn t kiss vita first i could go on and on these examples were all included when the series was only just started besides all these alterations from the facts the characterizations are also all wrong at times vita behaves like a mad woman especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper violet s engagement announcement is just ridiculous vita kept her surges of emotion inside it was violet who was temperamental and let her feelings good or bad show all vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted that s all being a gentle nature harold avoided confrontations in real life but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing harold and vita always discussed their intimate things in letters not verbally and violet i know that this series purposely concentrated on vita and harold but that doesn t mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines here she is totally one dimensional character and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow actually she was intelligent gifted quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves i have always thought her much more interesting person than vita in this series her unhappiness loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored viewer has also little clue of her background and family what kind of relation and marriage with denys trefusis she had or how hard she battled over vita vita was the only love of her life her raison d etre and if harold suffered during affair so did violet after it her life was in ruins and it took time that she could pull herself back together again statue could have acted the role of denys that much depth his character has lady sackville west is just a badly drawn caricature an annoying chatterbox with exaggerating french accent the series ends to the totally badly written scene in amiens and that was the end of this affair according to scriptwriter no it continued a whole year after that and it s ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here but what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start i have to give some credit to actors they tried to make best of those roles given to them though janet mcteer as vita is the only one who really shines through one can t complain the settings either all complaints go to director and most of all scriptwriter instead of insightful character studies there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation many of the scenes are too long some are pointless and don t bring anything to the story line on the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether especially there should have been more information about vita s and violet s youth and how their friendship developed this is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation maybe someday someone will do it at the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or violet s letters to vita which are brilliant stuff ,0
the somewhat belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way by acting out but that dad is morose and blaming himself writer director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams characters with question marks hanging over them and then lays all the story points out in the most obvious terms suicide secrets gay shame family sickness ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow harris wants to make sure we don t miss a trick initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary sentimental fashion sigourney weaver s bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she s a joy that is until harris gives her a make over complete with sensible new hairstyle it s the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head from ,0
strangeland seems to have a love hate relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about it the acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can t in some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late 90s over all dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i ve ever seen it plays on the fears of many age groups adult parents and children every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet and it does happen in the real world and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many my only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed ,1
the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names i e jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay in a positive note kim bassinger s and pat morita s performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid jason vanness,0
another of my delves into the bargain bin this movie gave me exactly what i expected a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies it all started so well i liked the little intro with the newsreel about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire from then onwards the film descended into outright silliness and at times became almost embarrassing to watch when the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character the ability to light one s own farts without the aid of a match it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment that ll be good you can almost hear them say as for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant well the movie came across as cheap tat if you pay more than 1 50 for it you ve been done ,0
the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz s most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i ve ever seen the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives like i said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children in fact i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla that alone should tell you what to expect here ,1
total crap i was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version i have seen of mansfield park i suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between henry and fanny i snapped and had to turn it off whoever employs this sylvestra le touzel lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress i ve ever seen in my life the whole thing is just bad bad bad i don t know i just don t know why people who write jane austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves ,0
this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were well acted well scripted and historically accurate i did actually read gregory s book and liked it well enough despite it s huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular but this movie didn t even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else aptly put the real world tudor england why are the camera angles so bad in general why is the script so bad i mean i know it was improv but come on the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it s obvious that they re making them up as they go along why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie they re just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii he s thrusting away and she s got this look on her face that says hm i need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick it s just bad why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom she s the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn t get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad ,0
bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct american animation company filmation on the back of he man masters of the universe and she ra princess of power in 1983 and 87 respectively the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall bravestarr who possesses the strength of the bear ears of the wolf speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk and his trusty sidekick a talking horse named thirty thirty who carried with him a gun aptly titled sarah jane and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge j b serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlaws set in futuristic texas this was and still is to this day one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city in the us hence in the south thousands of light years ahead in the future considering this was made in the 80s the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a sci fi based outlook bravestarr didn t just evoke morality and good verses bad as well as teaching children lessons about life but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldn t take things and life for granted and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon many of the story lines themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them in addition marshall bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ethnic minority background to make an impact on tv the sound effects were amazing the music was great the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong something of which the same cannot be said about today s cartoons sadly whilst bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of he man it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics suffice to say i preferred bravestarr over he man because of the diversity of the story lines characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast for some reason they resonated more with people because like for instance in the pledge where a kid dies from a drug overdose the fact that there wasn t a happy ending was important in the sense that when kids watch that episode well in fact anyone who watches that episode will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs bold brave and at times thought provoking bravestarr is definitely that bold brave and thought provoking a cult cartoon classic for many years to come it dared to take some risks but it had well and truly paid off in the end it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever and rightly so8 and a half out of ten,1
just kidding seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city jon voight is young optimist cowboy almost forest gump like joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street thugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warhol party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra urban new york city the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his out of place position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure hearted and out of place lead character and to an extent the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour a contrast between country cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend 8 5 10,1
didn t sound like it was from a fantasy film the film is dark with dark overtones the soundtrack way too uplifting to the point it intruded on the visuals i m sure they were aiming for something militant but it just didn t work the scene when astin is attempting to escape is a perfect example why does it sound like the goonies there is no comedy there is no brightness to this the idea of the movie is great and the acting is very good as well i enjoyed everyone s performances it s available on netflix s online viewing definitely worth a viewing but write your own soundtrack ,1
let me be up front i like pulp however it is like one of these easier dives that you see at the olympics it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of say a late medieval painter this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often or more accurately most of the time ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains if not always in the right way check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle however quite why it has been given a worst film razzie is baffling i bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006 but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim head case and popular novelist catherine tramell sharon stone is now over in london writing a novel but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather god heavens she can t even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood style yes clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around if you like your pulse to be above zero but is she personally responsible i mean why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual however is this just a personality disorder some form of b s risk addiction or further evidence of her guilt for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass david morrissey for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another lover found dead in mysterious circumstances thankfully for stone he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home working life of his own in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur in to this heady mix comes roy washburn a strange welsh sounding david thewlis who tells the love struck doctor in his capacity of policeman of many years standing that the lady in question may be dangerous i mean hold the front page however glass is now too glassy eyed to realise or care like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime time mike tyson he ripe for the big take down however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himself now comes millena gardosh charlotte rampling a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example in this film of someone who isn t barking mad or else a murder suspect presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stone s thankfully for us at least those days are long gone strangely she doesn t think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else or else she doesn t think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting after several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff hanger twist that while as farcical as the rest of the movie gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct 3 highly unlikely this may be at this point in time ,1
armoredthe best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money you can shoot them in the face and while the armoured guards in this thriller aren t using their protective power to purge the drifter population they are using their position to fleece their employer when newcomer ty columbus short lands a job with an armored trunk company he feels like he has found his lot in life unfortunately however when he discovers that his co workers matt dillon jean reno and laurence fishburne are plotting to take the 42 m shipment for themselves ty must fortify himself and the funds inside the armored truck a tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned in performances armored is an utterly forgettable film besides if you really want to jack millions it s a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an atm red light ,0
friday night with jonathan ross must have those in charge of ross rubbing their sweaty little palms together they know the bbc lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows so when they have jonathan ross at their disposal they are quite settled to just sit back and let a half wit command this primetime slot ross spends most of the show grooming his ego and smiling about how much the bbc is paying him the show is a complete copy of many us chat shows leno letterman conan o brian the list goes on but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the uk also the unfortunate situation he has no competition parkinson has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except grooming a celebs ego can t we have someone funnier and slicker on british screens instead of jonathan ross once ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room so trying to get on with each other if an a lister is present which is so often the case these days as there are no other chat shows they can turn to to promote their latest movie he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe sqeamish when he had ringo starr on a man that cares nothing for licking arse ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number as common policy on this show is for jonathan ross to get everyones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working of course ringo said it how it is and simply said no i don t like you dead pan serious ross needs to be axed from all awards and tv shows the masses will get over it ,0
screened at the san francisco international film festival under the title come undone april 25 26 27 2001 the cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling even with fall winter backgrounds for the present and spring summer for the flashbacks there can be some difficulty following the continuity whether either lead is gay the actors well portray the budding relationship in real life terms from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking the story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning but as the end approaches you really care about where these guys will be next summer you too will want a sequel to find out ,1
at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction however the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army the recognizable cast is hit and miss with glynn turman richard pryor and the underused billy dee williams faring best stephen boyd however stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn the obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values the locations are great the effects and action are weak imagine if saving private ryan had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way vin diesel s caparzo had except we do get to see the shot because they effects can t handle it then hanks damon and burns drove around in a jeep and shot five germans for the climax yet the denouement with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black and boyd s racist captain being effected by this is compelling as are the sequences of of turman s character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines in short black brigade carter s army doesn t quite succeed but it s a respectable failure not a bad joke it could be remade as a very good film and as it stands is an interesting effort ,0
one of my favorite movies i saw at preview in seattle tom hulce was amazing with out words could convey his feelings thoughts i actually sent mike ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed it is good system says i need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff i was in the audience in seattle with hulce and director a writer i think and mike ferrell they talked for about an hour afterwords not really a dry eye in the house why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know actually i do know it is our fault look what we watch well you get what you pay for guys get this and see it with someone special it is a gem ,1
 in 1955 tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon one year later he walked out of the jungle naked it took him 45 years to go back supposedly keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale in reality anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea mostly touting the native art the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe but really that s about it unless of course you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers i give up big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale merk,0
i m in awe wow prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja watch them as they pounce crawl along the ground on their backs or stomachs like a caterpillar fly through the sky climb buildings hide and spring from trees throw about ninja stars role out blue welcome mats disappear in smoke bombs make a lot of swoosh noises with their blades and quickly sneaking or trotting about on their toes what a sight really i could go on about the many traditional actions but i ll be here all day oh not to forget we even get the legendary chuck connors popping up now and again and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease what class what a badass anyhow the ultra cheap sakura killers is some stupid but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b grade debacle a genetic lab in america has a very important video that s stolen by a couple of ninjas two americans are sent to japan by the colonel chuck connors to retrieve it the opening of the feature sets it up nicely get ready for the laughs afterwards it slows down but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula this is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play it s not too shoddy either like the moronic script and daft performances the final climatic showdown is very well done in the slow stretches it has the two americans mike kelly and george nicholas looking in to the case sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems what made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were these were supposed to be professional killers director dusty nelson effects 1989 does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is he centres the on screen activities around striking taiwan locations the score is a chintzy arrangement ,0
the main problem with 9th company 9 rota is that it is not sure whether it wants to be saving private ryan or full metal jacket the attempts at spielberg sentimentalism are embarrassing such as the burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers the training sequences have none of intensity or realism that kubrick gave them in his masterpiece a further bone of contention is that the afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen here they attack a russian strong hold almost in formation with no attempt to use cover i am sure tactics have move on since waterloo every scene in this film has been seen before in other war movies and done considerably better i have to ask why do all talented marksmen need to chew on a match finally i am always suspicious of a film that starts with no narration yet needs to qualify the end we won errrr no you didn t ,0
if you read my review of syfy s dinoshark you know that i can appreciate the low budget schlock that these made for television movies can provide they re stupid they re silly but they re still pretty fun in a so bad it s good kind of way so still smacking with guilt for liking and recommending the undeniably hokey dinoshark i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy a syfy original movie about a half man half hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island with the syfy channel s sure fire recipe for creating b movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo how could it possibly go wrong well to my surprise it actually misses the mark not by much but enough to make me not recommend it why well first of all its titular monster the dreaded hammerhead human hybrid takes a backseat to a bunch of faux military thugs who really become the movie s primary villain though the hammerhead does rack up the body count he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after the rest of the movie is filler pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers that to me is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people please read the full review on my blog www horrormoviejournal blogspot com,0
i can t believe this isn t a huge cult hit perhaps people in 1968 thinking of the monkees as a silly factory made pop band rip off of the beatles refused to see it that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since don t make this mistake _head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate it is very funny and very intelligent and very trippy ,1
what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andre normal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we aren t ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesn t believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you can t believe it s really happening and that it s really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter ,1
i really enjoyed this episode which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired from a pure writing perspective the 16mm shrine is an absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of sterling in particular i really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode tackling themes of existence and reality whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial pride and desire the sixteen millimeter shrine is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever changing world it is also a fantastic example of cerebral twilight zone one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it these elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes the episode is not without its faults however which mainly lay in lupino and leisen shoes ironically i felt lupino was unconvincing throughout with only a few scenes that could count as memorable this of course being an absolute shame considering how well sterling had written her character furthermore leisen didn t seem to know what to do with most of his characters sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from lupino half the time thankfully balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least as i said previously however if you re a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction this shouldn t be as bad as it s sometimes made out to be in addition to the writing that i mentioned above the episode also features some fantastic photography it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later and decent enough set design overall the sixteen millimeter shrine is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think ,1
this movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which michael jackson wields a tommy gun plain and simple this movie rocks because it is freaking hilarious it may be creepy to see jacko w little kids but this movie also stars wait for it joe pesci think about it joe pesci and jacko with tommy guns throwing coins into jukeboxes from 20 feet away whats not to like as stated before this movie rocks ,1
this movie beats everything out there well depends on what you are looking for it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale this movie is in a complete league of its own i don t think any movie could possibly come close to it i am not sure what the director intended to make it as a thriller or a comedy if he did think he was making a thriller then he has by a stroke of luck created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time you have to see it to believe it a matrix terminator a host of other movies rolled into one along with a storyline dating back to 1980 s hindi movies with a icchadhari naag a mythical snake which can turn into a human its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side planning to laugh at the movie i am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10 on the basis of flipping a coin i have decided to give it a 1 ,0
my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos battle for space shown on russia s first channel on april 10 13 2006 bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it s the case the number of factual errors is such that it s impossible to list them especially in the first episode the development of first missiles even the u s half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions the audience is not told of any v 2 a 4 launches from the u s three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number ue onboard apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon etc in the russian half each and every person is ludicrous korolev is scared of nkvd glushko is saboteur and traitor mishin is alcoholic etc men as functions no motivation no life at all uniform and decorations are awful gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch i think this was added specially for russian version ,0
this is one of the few movies of this type i have reviewed and enjoyed while clint eastwood is his usual self the overall story works well even in the limits of washington d c the theme an assassin is tracking the president and there is only one person who may save him it cannot be easy to make a film which audiences enjoy these days involving this arena this film succeeds on several levels eastwood is his usual underplayed hero wanting to save the president since the kennedy era he does well in this role as does his foil reneee russo an fbi agent overall well done and suspenseful with extra stars for malkovich 9 10 ,1
this is to the zatoichi movies as the star trek movies were to star trek except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big shiny re do and also better made if substance is more important than surface had i never seen them i would have thought this good looking but empty since i had i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient the idea of reviving the character in a bigger slicker production must have sounded good but there was no point in it other than the hope of making money it s just a show which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character s world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn t been already also the actor wasn t at his best i d been hoping to see ichi at a late stage of life in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies seasoned with more sex and sfx violence not the same experience at all ,0
i am a huge shirley temple fan when i saw this movie it made me appreciate what a talented child shirley actually was ashley rose orr made possibly the worst on screen shirley imagine an 11 year old playing shirley temple from the age of 5 that in itself is wrong but getting her to mimick shirley s voice and her singing is woeful the dancing was good i ll say that as previous users have said there was little dramatic scenes nothing to make the story interesting not even amelia earhart i would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that shirley temple created there was too much focus on the wizard of oz when in reality shirley was just considered for dorothy the film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role shirley herself said that she is glad judy garland got to play her for me the star of the show was the lady who played gertrude temple otherwise stay away for great shirley temple films watch heidi poor little rich girl and little miss broadway ,0
i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you ll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city s diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris je taime s plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you ll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won t you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyone s opinion on art differs i m just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect ,1
jeremy northam s characterization of the stuttering mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu s presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face neck and lips no matter the brainwashing love has a way of persevering love also cannot be brainwashed in with either of his two fake wives in gradual stages he begins to dispense with his glasses to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses the music is fantastic hypnotic sexy and appropriately driving at times the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu s portrayal whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part she is just no match for northam s talents but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author ,1
the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s in the main the group s six men were bud flanagan chesney allen jimmy nervo teddy knox charlie naughton and jimmy gold hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late i often cringe when i see the statement it s very british because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it the reason it bothers me is because in this www internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing will hay and the imperious terry thomas so then is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience well yes it s true so much here is topically british but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal with the anarchic not so wild west make over an absolute winner a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there s some very talented people at work here now then dose the mounties always get their man 8 10,1
formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like a tv movie not really exciting the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell s part is very small and doesn t add much to the movie michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare ,0
this show had a lot of hype but i didn t know about it until the midseason season 1 someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the show s format i m happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed he s in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie and for some reason sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it even though she s sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesn t do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didn t care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldn t have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookie s grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jason then once sookie and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots tara s mother wants an exorcism then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasn t so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his grandmother s stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal he s only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her subtlety is not this show s strong suit it doesn t take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my assumption wasn t dead on it wasn t that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn t possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked lady s face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout as if that wasn t enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then it s time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the penultimate episode it s revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they shove renee being the killer in your face sookie remarks that it s odd that renee s thoughts don t have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to renee being a fraud but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of renee s boxes about how to fake a cajun accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie who still manages to kill renee they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church which makes me care about him even less it s almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better i m interested in seeing what happens in season 2 but if i watch it i ll most likely wait for the season completion ,0
i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal so for the kink value i give it one otherwise the video photography acting of the adults actors actresses are simply substandard a practical jock to people who love foreign movies roberto the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable however the children in the movie are mostly 3 4 years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life ,0
david webb peoples meets paul anderson if it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong the value of life etc he covered these issues in bladerunner unforgiven and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines paul anderson s first successful movie was a violent thriller not surprisingly so have all of his other movies and here is a violent thriller with moral implications peoples script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life they are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead there he must cope with a group of refugees some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here but then the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people big violent loud action ensues and peoples script turns into an anderson action fest it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then i expected entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thought provoking and exciting once the action starts 7 10rated r a lot of violence,1
this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor nunez that i ever say and boy am i glad i did its quiet tone its relaxed pace its realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life its fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life the decisions she makes based on real things the people she meets there is nothing wrong with this movie it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the star wars movies and given what those films are like that means this film deserves a high rating indeed ashley judds acting mr nunez writing and its great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming of age story and a wonderful movie ,1
grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide julie pyke cheri christian blames husband allen greg thompson for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it julie remains in a zombie state eliciting next to no emotion remote and numb only photographing a nearby abandoned prison finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell though allen doesn t see anything out of the ordinary julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn t quite right a local handyman jim payne scott hodges a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the pykes meanwhile the neighbors who sold the pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well alcoholic mr booth s abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin attempting to unravel the mystery about the place plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable cheri christian remains so vacuous and lost it s incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight the acting as is often mentioned remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to i guess it s supposed to be this way under their circumstances but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the pykes due to their constant state of aloofness cheri comes off as cold and detached as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could i think the right performers even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil can grab the hearts of their viewers if a humanity reaches out to us in this movie s case the leads are unable to do so for whatever reason it could ve been me i don t know i wanted to care for them but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings anyway as the film continues allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won t lose her little girl again jim the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the pykes becomes a vital threat the ghosts remain a central part of the movie their presence particularly jim s mother established throughout off in the distance the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart jim s mission i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters ,0
i guess it wasn t entirely the filmmaker s fault though the film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision to tell clayton moore who had done the role in the 1950 s and was the lone ranger us old folks grew up with he couldn t wear the mask in public now mind you the poor guy wasn t making all that much money doing so and it wasn t like he was going to take anything away from this film but the whole thing seemed gratuitous the other thing the film suffered from besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to overdub it was that fact that westerns weren t so hip in 1981 john wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decade long major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on genocide of the native americans that and blazing saddles sent up the whole genre the campfire scene enough said hollywood shied away from westerns because science fiction was cool then the one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken president grant and seriously i d have let grant stay with the bad guys the country would have been better off grant asks tonto what his reward should be honor your treaties with my people yeah right like that was going to happen ,0
this was director von stroheim s third effort it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks greed and the wedding march essentially we have a trio of grifters masquerading as a russian count and two russian princesses who have rented a villa in monte carlo their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune part of that plan is for the count von stroheim to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his foolish wife wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses he makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid whom he has promised to marry when she sees them together she sets fire to the room von stroheim and his prey are on the room s balcony here von stroheim first establishes his persona as the man you love to hate he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director there is a cute bit when he first attempts to meet the ambassador s wife she is reading a book we see the title foolish wives by erich von stroheim this was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage damaged in some way in most scenes from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print ,0
before barton jumps all over my remarks let s all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses we all have them i loved sigourney weaver jeff daniels i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime downplayed just perfectly and understated unlike some others i did not find this all predictable i found sigourney s role refreshingly humorous and realistic especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer i found it enjoyable and wasn t anticipating recommending this to all and sundry this is why there are different flavors of ice cream something to please everyone ,1
to some this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation others see it as a story of grace restoration and hope it is actually both henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion his downward spiral of sin and his upward climb of healing david and bathsheba is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity henry king handles the powerful story taken from the old testament with skill david the lion of judah having stormed the walls of rabgah saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah kieron moore and returns to jerusalem back at his court his first wife complains of neglect and offends him for being a shepherd s son distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul one evening and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood david s eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath she was beautiful and attractive david could not take his eyes off her he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers sending for her he discovers that she too is unhappy in her marriage by this point it s apparent that david s intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife to just plain taking bathsheba as usual sin had its consequences and david hadn t planned on that possibility when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses david tries to cover up his sin he sends word to joab the commander of his army and ordered him to send to him bathsheba s husband david did something that was abominable in god s sight he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor god punishes the couple when bathsheba s child dies soon after birth meanwhile a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites led by nathan blame the king for their plight they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity hayward as bathsheba is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history is badly mishandled and the viewers eyes are led briefly to hayward s face and shoulders raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to david s personality and kingship ex silent screen idol francis x bushman had a brief part as king saul the best moments of the film were the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object the defining moment in david s life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death and for the film s climax inserting it as a flashback david remembering his fight with the giant goliath with superb color photography and a masterly music score david and bathsheba won oscar nominations in the following categories music scoring art and set direction cinematography story and screenplay and costume design ,1
and this somebody is me and not only me as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater why did the people love it it s obvious everybody knows zombies by now at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the dawn of the dead reinvention or resident evil movies etc or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies that is until this movie came along and you ll see zombies in a new light perhaps this is not a horror movie although it does contain some violent scenes but is rather a comedy a satire to be precise and it never runs out of steam that is why i rated it so high pacing wise it s incredible the acting is great and the script has no obvious mistakes quite the contrary it s a gem and if you re only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it and even if you dislike them watch it because it s a great comedy movie ,1
i actually first watched one dark night in the theater wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper i loved it then i still love it the storyline revolves around two people first of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death the mauseleum he s buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group they go back in the night to scare her find scares for themselves the cast is led by meg tilly with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka e g daily check this one out if you love 80 s movies cheesy horror movies you won t be disatisfied ,1
i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since the plot has been well discussed so no need in going over it again the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings americans especially aren t going to get all the jokes the first time around i know i didn t this movie is funny touching sad all at the same time when ray proposes the toast at his daughter s wedding it s cringe inducing when karen calls tony brian as he attempts to kiss her it s heartbreaking when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black it s too funny for words and the music it s as good as any movie soundtrack i ve heard in years i was dancing in the living room to all over the world every performance is absolutely perfect bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray a man who has had one too many bad trips stephen rea is perfect as tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him but all the actors are equally brilliant ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it it s a gem ,1
this is the best comedy period it is so underrated clever witty humor great casting jerry stiller is the jewel in the show he is so incredibly funny and quirky simply a comical genius doug and carrie have great chemistry i so do not see what the hype is about when it comes to everybody loves raymond it is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and just not the witty show i can t remember laughing in more than 1 episode king of queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs which is normally caused by arthur spooner i think its about time this comedy gets the hype it deserves and not the lame raymond co ,1
for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt stone s comic timing is perfect there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing ,1
this was is an incredible movie with incredible cast music singing story etc it is a tragedy that some arrogant families the gerswhins or premingers can keep it from being available to generation after generation i have wanted to see it again all of my life i just found this site and read why it has not been available shame on these families for their pettiness my wife is from germany and she has never seen the movie neither have my step children or my grandchildren it is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see where do these families get off making such a conceited self important egotistical condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film these stars these performances this music release the video and let them world judge and enjoy ,1
i do get irritated with modern adaptations of shakespeare when the director can t make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it if it s using the original words in an updated setting that s particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work ok in period styles eg the trevor nunn twelfth night set late victorian very effectively it could work with the 30 s setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of shakespeare s text unfortunately it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show another problem is branagh himself i agree he s far too old to play one of the students but more important he s such an experienced shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student his strength of acting shows all the time of course he should have played the king no problem in having a mature student king surrounded by younger students instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the king thus an unimposing so called king with no kingly attributes the amount of song and dance which i found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing unfortunately meant the great shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically so the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection and i got very bored including with the comic turns and was glad when it ended branagh has not done shakespeare justice in this production accolades however to richard briers and geraldine mcewan absolutely splendid as the older couple ,0
this was a romantic simple funny movie i really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it will smith was funny fumbly nervous sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by love it was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say it was great he was great funny as usual eva mendes was better than i expected her to be as well i thought there were moments in the movie where will got the shaft he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad the ending was romantic and happy and it was great i have seen it several times and would watch it again a funny movie something you don t see a lot of anymore it had the old time feel with a fresh new look ,1
seeing les amants reguliers calls immediately for comparison with bertolucci s movie the dreamers in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in paris actually director philippe garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague sharing the principal actor and even including a direct replica eye in viewer eye about an older film of bertolucci and yet lar is a different film and an interesting one the story line seems also familiar the movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 emeutes maybe among the best done until now the film is made in black and white and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds eisenstein then as in the dreamers the action moves in the parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art smoke drugs dream and fall for one other there is no direct social comment no real explanation of the background of the revolt the movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters it s like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through it s just that not all the participants may adapt or survive the film is more about the characters than about the events and it is merely for the style it will be remembered about the black and white cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes but also when looking at the characters evolution many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune the effect is exquisite yet the length of the film is hardly justified it lasts more than three hours and i doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss actually i am convinced it s quite a contrary without raising at the depth and subtlety of bertolucci s movie lar is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of france and of the world in the 20th century ,1
the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet the movie which boasts just one human being in its cast young actress bertille noël bruneau tells the story of the rather rare though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox part nature documentary and part fairy tale the film focuses on l infant the child who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting possibly france though the exact location is never mentioned over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox who she begins to call lily once again and so it goes on days turn to weeks and then the summer disappears turning to fall and then winter promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping white winter landscape eventually spring comes around again and the young child finds her fox and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal and so on i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film making contained in that movie luc jacquet is a hugely talented and indeed rare film maker and i was expecting some superb breathtaking cinematography sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife this was delivered in spades but here jacquet has a screen writing credit and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in march a fictional story the child and the fox and the story is simple a young seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school seemingly on her own every day seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world without the hint of an adult in sight brilliant so she strikes up a friendship with a fox with a film like this you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of i d say six and up or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon not a 31 year old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent brilliant wanted and the like but me being the newbie london critic i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child now i have a few problems with this film as a 31 year old lad and loyal lover of all things cinematic i loved the wildlife and landscape photography it s visually stunning the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed as good as you will find on any of attenborough s efforts as an impressionable short attention spanning eight year old i loved about the first half hour then i lost interest it s a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child particularly the rather dark ending as a 31 year old male i was a little frightened in places wuss so it s not a child s film it s not really an adult film and i felt a little let down is it a good family film depends it s educational maybe and the film carries a message it s definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i m racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer it s hard but i know some will go see and fall in love this film it s very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks give it a try unsure well i d wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then paul heath http www thehollywoodnews com july 2008 ,1
terrific little film that stars mary astor as a go getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company but when the owner has to sell for health reasons she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman robert ames as the front even though she is the brains of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary basically still running everything and teaching him class she loves the dope but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos she is chased by a married but separated man ricardo cortez who isn t free but when a society gal catches ames everything goes to hell astor is just wonderful as the too smart woman who almost makes a huge mistake after she loses her man ames is good as the jerk but what does she see in him and cortez is good but doesn t have much to do kitty kelly is good as the sidekick dolores charles sellon is the original owner cather dale owen is the society babe and edna murphy is funny as daisy worth a look ,1
never i have seen a movie so terrible that i ve gone insane it was a huge waste of time seeing this crappy film there are a lot of things i hate about this movie the songs is so terrible yet a little bit catchy i hit my head on the wall especially from the song grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of santa which i hit 10 times shrugs the character design and that evil greedy and bitchy cousin mel i cannot stand her for one second she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i ve seen even though i kinda like her southern voice the only bright side is that austin bucks is played by the person who is the voice of liquid snake from metal gear solid i would not recommended to people to watch for the holidays as it was a huge disgrace for x mas ,0
this tv made thriller is all talk little action it works hard to set up its convoluted plot yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best by the end i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning it has a quasi ten little indians scenario but ditches it mid way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer field overacts here with a gracelessness i ve seldom seen from her the early introductions are good but the writing quickly strays off course and eventually goes over the top lots of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects which adds nothing a curious failure from producers aaron spelling leonard goldberg with all this talent couldn t they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet ,0
every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong ,0
i waited almost 25 years to see this movie thinking it might be an underrated work from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been it starred one of the best film villains of all time was based on a beloved series of children s books and was a disney studios production what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs almost everything well not everything vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini s swanky score are the movie s two saving graces price is wickedly enjoyable and mancini more professional than the material deserves they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity meanwhile the rest of the movie while filled with inappropriately adult situations still suffers from a completely dull script blandly generic voice work terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldn t have been out of place on any of disney s mid 1980s saturday morning tv shows this was a complete disappointment to me it s amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh costing a fraction of this an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time the extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and mancini ,0
like another poster mentioned ch 56 a local boston tv station showed this multiple times over the years on saturday afternoons they paired it with the first sequel return of the ginat majin now i haven t seen it since then but it never left me aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy technically it isn t horror until the statue comes to life at the end it s just about a village ruled over by an evil man there s a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them to no avail but things go too far the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guys but then it starts going after the good guys too well done with some cool special effects at the end loved how he got rid of the main bad guy also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too no masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasy horror film worth catching but not if it s the dubbed print ,1
the filmmakers neglected to connect the dots that is the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the anti soviet mujaheddin to al qaeda and osama bin laden and eventually to 9 11 the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back story why were the soviets in afghanistan but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for islamicist extremists in afghanistan in the name of rabid anti communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today 9 11 terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in afghanistan etc because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr wilson hey check out his latest projects on the internet instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole ,0
an extremely powerful film that certainly isn t appreciated enough it s impossible to describe the experience of watching it the recent uk television adaptation was shameful too ordinary and bland this original manages to imprint itself in your memory ,1
this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view sometimes it worked other times it did not tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though keep the apidistra flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war acting was okay script was okay overall it was a mediocre film ,0
whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted the script was dull plodding and nothing we have not seen before not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest after all didn t everyone on the planet see schindler s list ,0
i know it s hard for you americans to find european films on video dvd particularly from the 80 s but please seek out the original version of the vanishing title spoorloos 1988 and you ll see why the hollywood version of the vanishing screws up bigtime particularly at the finale i really like sandra bullock kiefer sutherland and particularly jeff bridges but this is just so so lame compared with the original what where they thinking can you imagine seven with a happy ending with gwyneth paltrow running happily into the arms of brad pitt in the finale the whole point the original was such a major international success was because of the shocking finale so why do you accept this kind of shyte remake really avoid this and get the original ,0
clifton webb as mr scoutmaster is one of the all time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence now diminished in the world i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie although i have requested it time and again this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty respect dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis there is so much low self esteem talked about in present daily lives but this movie among many many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the present day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences it certainly appealed to us baby boomer generation of yesterday old lessons are universal and timeless ,1
the main achievement of this film is that though racially unipolar the film still manages to carve out a tableaux of war portrayals that leave a lasting identification with whoever may view it and whoever was present at this time though good films may have the ability of universalizing their subjects which is often a hard thing to do great films have the ability of universalizing their unipolar subjects which is what this film does instead of carving a context of unity the film depicts the japanese in the sick finality of the phillipines war front in february 1945 making signs for pacifism or war but rather making signs of the feelings death destruction victory and sickness of war with the bloody hands of the defeated far different and superior to films such as apocalypse now and full metal jacket both which needed a satirical methodology of trivializing and depersonalizing the american troupes and using all races as one struggle which is fine yet not as grand as a film that uses one race and view which would look fascist if created in america to convey the horror of war and show what it is really like the only way the main character makes it through this movie to the end is by being sick thence inedible hence through this character through his sickness his saving face we see the end of wwii in the phillipines in february of 1945 and the way in which the americans japanese and phillipinians came together in bloody acts of warfare where you live to die the film is patently influenced by a neorealist way of filmic portrayal which is original and beneficial to a viewer whether then or now for the neorealist techniques it employs conveys all the horrors of war in pictorial form whether a showcase for pacifism or militaristic responsibility like germania anno zero by roberto rossellini a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it the film s opening with the two way discussion between the two japanese soldiers prefigures and reechoes the events through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human and human with human it shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in the past battles but now in this opening or pivot of the experiences of the japanese in the phillipines new information is relayed to the main character tamura giving a presentiment of a cannibal reliance on one another if they wish to survive the jungle is gritty wet and thick and the sky is not infrequently cloudy and pouring we wade with the stragglers though puddles and marshes as sick as the land around them nameless cadavers are strewn everywhere every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies rocks or corn apparently there is no difference here all is dead and sick all is dying all they have lest to feed upon are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades and or nameless enemies often tamura meets a fallen other near death though crushed in spirit and crushing his some offer up their bodies for him to eat but he refuses he still like hiroshi kawaguchi as nishi in giants and toys will not droop into the death of dignity and japanese morals for this is all he really has to hold up for his survival a dignity of self hence when nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption he shoots him because of it tamura may be used to the killing but to the sickness of killing and pillaging he can t decipher he is neither a good man or a bad man he wishes to survive but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straight war killing his self belonged dead on the battlefield he isn t happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survival the sickness he carrys he sees everywhere in everyone and sadly he lacks the ethical rationale of thinking either thinking entirely about others since he can t give up his body for them since of his contagious malady or thinking entirely about himself since he sees the sickness in everyone though still killing them even if they do no harm seen in his attack on the two philippians s in the hut he can t see anyone no one can see anyone the only see an aversion from malady and an adversion to health the heart of survival instincts often an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen towards what must be hope for there in that far thule lies their freedom yet it is blocked by american soldiers leaving the japanese stragglers to slowly die in this disconsolate dirt even a church tower appears reflecting the light off an unseen sun but on closer inspection crows flutter wildly about it religion too is an air of poison nobi the japanese title of the film gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film the servitude to fate the heaviness of existence under leaders and lives controlled by others its proper anglophone translation has a subject of heavy debate among historians as non koreans translate it as slave and slavery while many koreans argue that nobi was not a slave system but a servant class system that does not meet the criteria for slavery a way to typically to escape wrenching poverty this improves upon the war theme and symbolism of soldiery isn t it important at the time period to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will become our won history should we be comfortable of letting it unroll without conscious effort for change is it not who we are fighting that age old history question but rather why are we fighting fires on the plain is with eiji funakoshi osamu takizawa and mickey curtis based on a novel by shohei ooka in japanese with subtitles ,1
a spaceship returns from mars about a couple of months earlier a 4 person expedition had been sent to the red planet most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there the picture is saddled by inane melodramatic dialog typical of many sci fi efforts of the fifties sixties note for example how the ship s commander mohr tells another crew member to stay there for no reason as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem later the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside the two he ordered to stay say no way and follow out i didn t have high hopes for the expedition s success by this point there s much talk of ears twitching and hugging a freeze ray gun named cleo short for cleopatra of course it would at least be pretty funny unintentionally if the story didn t drag there s a very slow pace to the whole thing the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship s window portals which change color from red to blue commenting on what they see as they do outside actually exploring the martian landscape advertised as filmed in cinemagic usually resembles animation cut outs or drawings shot through an orange red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process but i don t think it fools anyone over 10 years old the one clever mention i did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista oh okay i was amused by some of the astronauts actions as they begin to explore right off the bat they test their freeze gun on a plant killing it just for the hell of it then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider rat monster nice going lady look up next time no wonder the intelligence on mars gets upset and doesn t mind that one of the lower lifeforms a giant amoeba attacks the explorers the acting isn t too impressive mohr especially had a very annoying technique saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out reminded me of it the terror from beyond space the ending is fairly anti climactic don t expect any huge revelations beyond the no more expeditions with freeze guns named cleo ,0
great movie great actors great soundtrack i loved it settings are perfect dialogues situations storyline all together mixed to give this masterpiece clooney and turturro are magnificent and the soggy bottom boys are simply charming and contagious with their music :),1
susan slept here turned out to be dick powell s swan song as a performer on the big screen of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died it s a pity he didn t go out with his performance in the bad and the beautiful frank tashlin has done so many better films i m still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one the premise is absolutely laughable dick powell is a screenwriter who s looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he s been writing he had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in herb vigran and horace mcmahon deposit 17 year old debbie reynolds on his doorstep she s not a really bad kid and they don t want to put her in the system so they give her to dick powell at christmas time i mean is there anyone out there who doesn t see a problem the term jailbait comes immediately to mind additionally powell has a girlfriend the young and sexy anne francis why debbie reynolds is any competition here is beyond me susan slept here got one oscar nomination the song hold my hand sung by don cornell in the background was nominated for best song but lost to secret love powell and reynolds do have some funny moments together and alvy moore as powell s factotum and les tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs but it s not enough ,0
when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china s devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930 s he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man there are many stories inside this one many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended 9 10 stars :),1
as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or vedma as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it can t scary even a little kid it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking it s bad in all points from the goofy plot i don t know why the russian producers director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer it doesn t thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors work all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn t even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i don t really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in estonia and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it doesn t irritate me that s why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film don t waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i d advise you to find a copy of viy or the spirit of evil it s really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better ,0
i turned 13 when elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first rca hit a year later buddy holly stepped in to give the king some competition one of buddy s major talents besides his unique singing style and his songwriting ability is often downplayed buddy was also a skilled lead guitar player developing a unique rockabilly style all his own on his fender strat gary busey attempts to capture this aspect of buddy s persona there were other contemporary master guitar rockers of equal caliber such as chuck berry carl perkins and eddie cochran but buddy s talent is often overlooked as noted by others busey is the driving force behind the success of the buddy holly story not only does the script play with the facts of buddy s life but it even interjects several anachronisms for the two years of buddy s popularity basically 1957 1959 one that comes to mind is the scene where buddy and maria are watching a 3 d movie buddy is disenchanted with it all and tells maria that it ll never last it s just a fad in reality there were no 3 d movies in circulation at the time the heyday for 3 d was in the early 1950 s by 1955 the fad had already faded yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believable at times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding buddy s career the story about how the crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie another problem with the film is how buddy s parents are depicted certainly buddy s parents were supportive of his musical career maybe baby is credited to buddy s mother and she did have input into the writing of the song it s good that buddy s biggest hits were used in the movie but i miss hearing one of my favorites i m looking for someone to love i m proud that as a result of this movie buddy s music was reissued for a new generation to hear his legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock n roll rave on buddy rave on ,1
the secret of kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films i have ever seen before watching this film i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo in to win in this category but i found in kells a serious contender the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan who lives with his uncle the abbot of kell the abbot is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy s imagination when the legendary brother aidan who looks surprisingly like willie nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once with aisling s help he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book which legend has it can turn dark into light see my full review of the secret of kells at http theoscarsblog blogspot com 2010 02 movie review secret of kells html,1
this movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better the last one heaven can wait was great i suggest you see that one this one is not so great the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today however i don t know what happened to the first two parts of this movie it plays like some really bad b movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit com the situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie it all seems real fake and the editing is just bad i don t know how they could release this movie like that anyway the last part isn t to bad so wait for the video and see it then ,1
dont let the mpaa fool you with their rated r for extreme violence there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s t i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense avoid ,0
no idea how this is rated as high as it is 5 8 at the time of writing but this movie was absolutely horrible the acting wasn t entirely bad but it really had no point whatsoever and the overall quality was poor its obviously a b movie or a c if such a thing exists and it looks like it was made over a weekend at a friends house or something im all for low budget movies and i generally watch any i come across but this one is really really bad i mean like the fanglys bad i don t know what else to say but trust in this as i have indeed sat thru this horrible horrible movie and i can save you the effort don t bother seriously just don t ,0
while this movie isn t a classic by any stretch it is very entertaining as i remember it i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed arthur and though it isn t as funny as that movie it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with arthur ,1
 silverlake life is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward actually it was more like a home movie and if you want dramatic illuminations see something else and it s by no means a tearjerker but i mean that in positive ways it shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with aids is affecting the quality of their every day lives it s almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not because it was so undressed that i had to look for other ways to respond it s an admirable film actually one of the most admirable sincere documents i ve ever seen these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts it makes hollow wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless these men made this movie for themselves which is one of the best reasons to create something the scene where tom sings you are my sunshine to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing ,1
i hope the writer director editor and composer and let s not forget producer read this because their work was truly incredible on this movie let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times every second of this movie is touching every scene is classic the acting is real the movie is honest you can relate to these characters as people not actors this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives the story is carefully thought out and every sub plot is intertwined and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside crispen glover daniel roebuck dennis hopper and joshua john miller as a 12 year old boy give absolutely amazing real performances i ve seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie it s that good great job everyone who worked on this great job the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting with the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i ve ever seen this movie is real it s honest it s a true movie experience which i will never forget you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore ultimately it s about people being people and everyone can relate to that i recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film ,1
i live in salt lake city and i m not a mormon so why did i rent this movie well because i live in utah and thought it d be nice to see locations i know in a film i really knew going into it that i wasn t going to get the inside jokes so i wasn t surprised when i sat with the deer in the headlights stare what i was surprised at was the ant non mormon actions that were placed in this film i know it s a mormon film catered to the members of the lds church but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isn t of their faith every non mormon which wasn t many drank smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude why that really ticked me off about this film they made the mormons so pure yet the rest of the state of utah i guess is filled with punk psychos just because they don t follow the scriptures of the lds church i can understand having the plots revolve around all lds members but you d think salt lake city was 100 mormon which isn t even close to being the truth and as i said the non mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks please i guess i just don t get it because i don t belong to their faith and i guess i never will ,0
i first saw this film in video form even on a television screen the vistas were impressive seen on the big screen in its full glory it must have blown people away as one or two other comments have pointed out the story of the early pioneers and how they got around the problems of terrain etc on the road to oregon is as authentic as any film can be it therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth something that today s film makers should take heed of reality is enough the plot relies on the struggle of man against the elements and hostile natives subplots are few and simple but the basic plot is enough elsewhere i have reviewed paramount s rival to the big trail fighting caravans in spite of having a more sophisticated plot and having better actors fighting caravans lacks the breathtaking scenes the big trail should be compulsory viewing ,1
spoiler bunch of passive aggressive people having family reunion the script has them saying and doing things people would never do at least anyone with a shred of decency the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion unaware she will show up as his brother s girlfriend at the reunion he tries to defer to his brother s claim but she knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch at one point she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him he tries to cover his eyes his heart is breaking she thinks it s funny until she suddenly decides she doesn t want the brother and leaves the reunion the movie really drags the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable we almost walked out but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up but nooooo all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this comparing it to little miss sunshine jeez shame on them the writers the actors the producers and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen ,0
i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years i had never seen this adaptation so when i had heard of it i came here and read all the excellent reviews on that basis i eagerly ordered it from netflix what a cruel disappointment they have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression a single tone upon which to base their flat characters although this adaptation seems to have used every word that jane austen wrote they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion even though it was done as a miniseries this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week mr bennett too harsh mrs bennet just a chattering chipmunk mr darcy as lifeless as a nutcracker the bennett girls almost indistinguishable and mr wickham a man who no one would look twice at hardly the appealing cad i m quite put out ,0
 murder over new york is an entertaining entry in the charlie chan series of films but if you re paying attention a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye while traveling to new york city for an annual police convention chan sidney toler meets former scotland yard investigator hugh drake frederick worlock on the same flight now employed by military intelligence drake is tracking paul narvo and his hindu servant suspected for acts of sabotage around the world drake believes that by contacting narvo s elusive wife he ll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal when drake winds up dead in the library of george kirby president of the metropolitan aircraft corporation charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called tetrogene administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken summoning kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together chan and police inspector vance donald macbride question those in attendance as one of them may be the killer among them are herbert fenton melville cooper a fellow oxford student of drake s actress june preston joan valerie unknown to drake but requested by him to attend ralph percy kane richmond the chief designer at kirby s aircraft company and keith jeffrey john sutton kirby s stock broker kirby butler boggs leyland hodgson is also a suspect especially after number 2 son jimmy victor sen yung catches him steaming open a cablegram the contents of which concern boggs himself there are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well mrs narvo turns up as patricia west marjorie weaver and contrary to drake s suspicion that she might lead him to narvo is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage she s involved with david elliott robert lowery principal of a chemical research firm and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle as with many chan films racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings this one offers two glaring ones when kirby s black servant is brought in for questioning he states that he doesn t know anything about drake s murder that he s completely in the dark chan s response condition appear contagious later following inspector vance s order to round up all the hindu s in new york jimmy chan comments on their arrival with they re all beginning to look alike to me actually the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie as shemp howard impersonates hindu mystic the great rashid but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist shorty mccoy before the movie s over two more victims fall to the clever narvo his confederate ramullah and aircraft magnate kirby himself to uncover the killer chan in concert with elliott arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed tr4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before before it can release it s deadly poison the brit fenton catches the falling capsule in mid air revealing that he knew about the plant arrested and brought in for questioning chan asserts that fenton is not narvo the real narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous fenton anxious to maintain narvo s secret but chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt and reveals the real murderer narvo now in the guise of stock broker jeffrey having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident now for the plot holes when first investigating hugh drake s murder it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests however jeffrey narvo was present at the dinner party it had already been established that drake had one non party visitor in the library chemist elliott if the fingerprints really did not belong to narvo then making them an issue was pointless also at the end of the film when narvo offers fenton the poisoned water how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness but going even one better than that how would a world traveling saboteur like narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a new york city stockbroker it just doesn t make sense for trivia fans a few more points bear mentioning in the film number 2 son jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to pop s aid to solve the case in the prior chan film charlie chan at the wax museum jimmy was a law student the poison gas formula would get reworked in a later chan film this time by monogram with roland winters in the chan role in docks of new orleans in that story poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its victims ,1
 that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version despite all of the other comments written here i really prefer the bette davis version even though the novak version has a more coherent story line however davis mildred s raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute and it is those raw emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair of failure of otherness strong emotions that he represses davis mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without censure she has no feelings of despair or of failure or of otherness rather she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era novak s portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis almost through the the whole movie davis mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth novak s vulnerability was excellent davis realism was monumental imdb votes concur ,1

once again the posters lied to me the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content explosive when i read the synopsis for this movie i was expecting to see a townful of grotesques every man jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation into such a den of vice would come the clean shaven hero shining gabriel instead the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect the first few minutes of the film showed us that middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether fiddling a little to make ends meet drinking to forget the pain or watching cock fighting chickens not penises to while away the boredom in other words the townspeople were desperately ordinary the only deliberate grotesque in the piece was gabriel the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury if i were kind i would suggest that the paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith unfortunately brian kirk is so inept a film maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty plus minutes of dark hackneyed tedium my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of guess the accent broken up with rounds of spot the location are we surprised that gaybo ends up stealing his brother s child and suffocating his father of course not he s a bible bashing preacher and therefore psychotic all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie but i suspect that they ve just realised what a turkey they ve put their names to the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace superman returns as the worst film of 2006 one hell of an achievement v1 20061114 v2 20080107,0
am i the only one to think that this is a bad movie i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects but the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful miserable story the idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny but what the writer made out of it is stupid bad acting the actors move like marionettes they play and look like people who really try hard but completely fail to act bad fx especially the explosion of the van looks unspeakably cheap it is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff ,0
i remember that hey hey fuss i saw the jackson jive it was a pretty straight forward comedy skit but i saw this it is free is out in the clear have i missed something if the black community should be complaining about any racist comments in a tv show it should be this if you ve read my earlier comments i am not the easy to offend guy the basic plot is that an african american moves in next to this white guy they make these racist comments like the value of a house will drop just because of black neighbours the white guy makes references like if your easily offended by racial slurs do not read on nig nog jungle boy sambo i apologise but that really happens in this show i really am a guy who is fine with the black community people might say hey lighten up but even when you take the racial slurrs away it is un funny no new jokes badly acted i can swear in one episode i saw someone s eyes focus on something unconnected with the situation all in all horrible comedy ,0
 who loves the sun works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious it s been a while since i ve found such a thoroughly touching thoroughly enjoyable film the film is gorgeous drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human very flawed and yet very likable characters due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic i recommend who loves the sun it s a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness ,1
the recent death of stephen bach one of the producers of heaven s gate has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on tcm exposing the film in ail probability to its largest audience ever i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd avenue cinema across the street from bloomingdales i think it was released on a friday and withdrawn on the following wednesday maybe that wasn t a fair release but it was and is a terrible film seeing the full length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to articulate why first there is the dreaded phrase mise en scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined basically it s everything that happens in front of a camera for example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action if there s another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action all of the extras do this then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing this is mise en scene in the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi dimensional the importance of defining mise en scene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier en scene even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop an auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director s body of work a theme or themes discerned the metier en scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper it is the difference between say john ford and sam wood the second point is how the director michael cimino got into the position of directing films cimino first gained prominence directing the first million dollar tv commercial this depicted a chevrolet floating down the grand canal in venice this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old so cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over the top image and so he learned his first film thunderbolt and lightfoot 1974 has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a lunatic s car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one i had the feeling that if the producer eastwood hadn t stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed which brings us to heaven s gate i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in snatches like a mini series it can be impressive this is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise en scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it s just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this its like sex at some point it just becomes a whipping there is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at harvard brilliantly photographed at oxford it is something of a non sequitur i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _ now i m gonna tell you what i m gonna tell you of most films however the whole preface adds up to only one line kris kristofferson and john hurt went to harvard together now twenty years later all of that time money and effort not to mention all of the audiences attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information then there s the scene in the street between kristofferson and masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information it s just so exhausting there is just one scene after another like this it s like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible witless dialogue which go on and on and are exhausting and boring of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant overall it s a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about seen in snatches with the possibility of fast forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise en scene whipped it s basically painless but don t let anybody tell you it s a good film when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times that s symbolic he said of he doesn t know which way to go that is basically at its kernel the basis of every pro heaven s gate critique watch it if you must but be forewarned this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time heaven s gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme i recommend the book banditti of the plains by asa mercer on the johnson county war ,0
i had the pleasure of attending a screening of the pacific and eddy last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival this film had caught my attention a little while back when i stumbled across an article about it in jalouse magazine seemed interesting at the time but nothing too exciting anyhow i saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out all i can say is that i was speechless when the ending credits began to roll this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that i have seen in some time the photography art direction acting and especially directing were seamless and impeccable nothing is spelled out for you in this film and actually makes you think something that a vast majority of films today do the exact opposite the dialogue is carefully crafted and although this script is not wall to wall chatter the characters words are very deliberate and meaningful it s definitely one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it the more things you notice it s a very layered and intelligent film not sure when or where it s playing again but a definite must see for film enthusiasts ,1
the film chaos takes its name from gleick s 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie chaos nothing the film makers seem to have skimmed the book obviously without understanding a thing about it looking for a theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film in this respect the movie choas resembles the canadian effort cube in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed in cube a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes the same approach is taken in chaos disconnected extracts from gleick s books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever this of course is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience and any literate viewer of chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered how could a film so bad be made rewritten as a novel the story in chaos would probably not even make it past a literary agent s secretary s desk how could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film regarding what s in the movie every performance is phoned in save for technical glitches it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene the story is uniformly senseless the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight year old among other massive shortcomings are the following the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints police officers do not carry or use radios dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film if there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead ,0
anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the 109 minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967 s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of 4roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr,0
i never heard of this film til it played as part of a robert mitchum retrospective at the national film theatre in london almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names in addition to top billed mitchum in the public domain charles mcgraw not long off the killers barbara bel geddes long before dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of theatre set designer norman walter brennan who needed no introduction frank faylen the sadistic male nurse in the lost weekend and the much nicer small town mensch in it s a wonderful life robert preston still a decade away from harold hill in the music man with tom tully and phyllis thaxter making up the numbers alas most of them were wasting their time i looked in vain for any signature scenes given that it was robert wise on bullhorn by this time he d made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style the story is our old friend the range war and mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the hopalong cassidy oaters on which he d cut his teeth there are no new twists if you don t count the unbelievable scene when mitchum accuses preston of sleeping with thaxter to gain information about her father s plans to move his cattle this is perfectly true but how did mitchum know we ve seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it on balance not a lot to be said for this ,0

it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writer director it has the aura of reality the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseanna with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman s hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feel good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means the loved ones ,1
1st watched 4 30 2009 4 out of 10 dir john waters corny waters like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn t make a whole worthwhile experience john waters directed this music filled spoof of the fifties scene with johnny depp playing the title role this movie is very similar with what he did with the 60 s spoof entitled hairspray but this one is not as effective some of the tunes are catchy some of the characters are interesting in their quirky waters like way and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone the storyline is similar to the movie grease where there is a good group and a bad group the guy from the bad group cry baby wow s a girl from the good group the good girl then joins the bad group but once cry baby hurts her she falls back to the good group this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back now one difference that is expected in water s movies is that the bad group doesn t appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you know what i definitely saw this in hairspray as well the wacky and goofiness isn t really all that much fun in this movie though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better the prime appeal of the johnny depp character is that he s able to make one tear roll down his cheek thus his namesake at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him this is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is ok but not that great ,0
imagine that dragnet episode where friday and gannon go into a typical 1970 den of hippie inequity but instead of giving everyone a lecture they get some that s joe in a nutshell this film of a working class bigot and a rich guy who s just killed his girlfriend s drug dealer boyfriend has dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is stilted but it s still interesting to watch peter boyle then about 35 plays joe the bigot and he looks like james gandolfini in her film debut susan sarandon plays the doe eyed daughter and while she doesn t necessarily hint at her future greatness you can t take your eyes off her ,1
i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara int l film festival it is extremely absorbing and very well crafted drawing you into the life and career of harry nilsson one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960 s and 70 s while i was familiar with his better known compositions one is the loneliest number without you i learned about this man s brilliant writing and beautiful singing if you love music you ll find plenty to draw you in to his world which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him however sad he nonetheless was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so glad to have met this man the profile is effectively told through nilsson s own words and those of his friends and colleagues a virtual who s who of rock who loved and respected him don t miss this ,1
lillian hellman s play adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states via the mexico border they settle in washington with the wife s wealthy mother and brother though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is the wise honest direct refugees teaching the clueless head in the sand americans how the world has suddenly changed it seems a little patronizing the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives place being lectured to lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his spouse bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesn t allow her much color their children all with divergent accents are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong the intent here was to tastefully tactfully show us just because a wwii era man may be german that doesn t make him a nazi sympathizer we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this tasteful tactful movie is made up of exposition defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a heady mix but instead it s rather dry eyed and inert from ,0
tasteless i can t even write intelligently about the movie i laughed the entire movie it wasn t supposed to be funny matt farnsworth has no clue what he is doing his story is written it seems without any knowledge of iowa culture and the meth problem i know farnsworth is from iowa which makes his movie even more puzzling to me why do the two main characters have accents it doesn t make any sense the acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch gratituous violence and sex filled the movie i am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy but it came across as unbelievable and offensive the ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all i could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief as i walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me the ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears but it did the exact opposite do not waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant sappy overacted clichéd drivel ,0
this is indeed a god adaptation of jane austen s novel compared with the american version with guinneth paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book but the acting was awful besides kate beckinsale who i believe was a true likeness of the emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard mark strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be he was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for emma at all this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partner s moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast hariett smith played by samantha morton seemed to have no real attachment to mr elton played by dominic rowan therefore she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book the settings of the film are also too poor the costumes are even more so i would have imagined emma woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here the ending is also too long it is good that it resembles the book s ending but it is a killer ending for a film and again i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mr knightley to conclude i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all i would prefer to see the lighter version with paltrow and northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors excepting the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale ruin the entire script ,0
i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with drug induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate s drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough i ll grant you but still acceptable then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books so this seven foot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped up dragons is added to the mix of mayhem the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nose diving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i don t know where i would have preferred to live in summary this movie is terrifying if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy ,0
the longer this film went on and it seemed to tediously go on for ever the more annoyed i became as quite frankly what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense how on earth do people get to make films like this or indeed receive finance for such rubbish don t be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal gun culture anyhow the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl he comes across a family with two spoiled brat children a teenage girl and boy taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope the cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice versa and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression a total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally ask yourself who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash this film is pointless drivel it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music 2 10 ,0
this movie is simply excellent for some reason it wasn t a success at the box office in india in new york however i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india everyone gives a good performance amir khan however just takes over and puts the movie over the top ,1
i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie of course as i m sure you know that malcolm s in the middle star frankie muniz and the ever so sweet amanda bynes the amanda show starred in this children s comedy as two friends that i m sure that we can all re late to the movie is about a boy jason shepard frankie and his friend kaylee amanda going onto an adventure in hollywood spoilers aheadas it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life s problems one day jason is hit by mr wolf the big bad director jason s english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his father s trust back they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back and all he has to do is call jason s dad and tell him he stole his idea but the end is no real surprise being the good proveles and wins the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it s rated pg i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies not only is the childrens acting great exceptional casting well written but it s good clean fun it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it s innocent message i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten the unemployed critic isn t unemployed for nothing i give it well i voted a ten out of ten a perfect ,1
brian de palma s undeniable virtuosity can t really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thinly disguised psycho carbon copy but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax his blow out made the next year was an improvement ,1
the phenomenon helge schneider defies easy description or quick categorization yet for the international audience not acquainted to him one could say he s something like a crude mix of weird al yankovich and andy kaufman adding a foible for jazz music and 70s outfits while his stage performances already are eccentric his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous 00 schneider is in my opinion helge s best movie he stars in the two leading roles police detective kommissar 00 schneider and murderer villain nihil baxter and also in a precious smaller role as physician dr hasenbein in the opening scene we see how modern art loving baxter accidentally kills the circus clown bratislav metulskie from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used jaguar when a beloved sculpture slips out of baxter s hands fatally hitting metulskie upon reading about the incident in the newspaper 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick lt koerschgen who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name they pick up baxter s track quickly and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion one of the movie s best scenes but initially fail to gather any proof the story winds through many turns with several scenes that don t always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny such as a daydream by 00 including the most unusual view on a running man s brief clad crotch in movie history a police department party during which koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized and a visit at the already mentioned dr hasenbein s baxter then is finally caught attempting to escape to rio de janeiro on a plane always worth special mention is andreas kunze who in this case plays 00 s wife as he s usually appearing in drag performing women s roles in helge s movies so all you folks out there looking for new laughs i strongly recommend this movie the catch you have to understand german as i doubt there s an english version around ,1

this is the second eytan fox film i have seen the fantastic actor lior ashkenazi who starred in walk on water has a minor role in this film also but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment noam ohad knoller lulu daniela virtzer and yelli alon friedman and the palestinian that joins them off and on ashraf yousef joe sweid there is sort of a friends sex in the city thing going on mostly gay and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace but that s the rub no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have the war is not going to end many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason there are many on the israeli side both there and here in the us who just want it all and will not consider peace there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come it is in no one s interest to end this war and the children suffer this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film it won t go away you know something tragic is going to happen and of course it does with the feelings on both sides running strong and revenge as the motivator tragedy always happens and that is what makes this an adult version of friends sex in the city there is no superficiality it is real life and it was a beautiful thing to see ,1
this film is on my top 20 comedies list this is a truly unique film to the reviewer who said i must be really missing something you are correct you are missing something if you don t have the kind of sense of humor this film requires that s one thing but don t give it a bad review because you think it s looney but isn t intended to be loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being i laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than i do at most other funny films michael almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an independent spirit award for best first feature crispin glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now harry dean stanton puts in an excellent comic performance william burroughs is incredible in a small role dylan mcdermott was ideally cast and lois chiles is completely excellent all of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of crispin s finest performances up there with his performances in river s edge and willard if you are a crispin glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is you re doing and see this immediately but just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something this is a great film but it is very unusual and i recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing ,1
poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure you re in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life ,1
the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin s adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10,1
the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker a young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived extremely boring and very predictable in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie avoid this one at all costs ,0
this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies stallone ever made this is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself first blood pt 2 is very similar to schwarzenegger s commando but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys this movie is a typical american anti soviet propaganda true this was the peak of the cold war but i m sick of having communists or the nazis always being shown as the enemy there are so many american movies that have this one thing in common why can t there a movie that show americans as the enemy who s going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army do you really think that something like this would have really happened by the looks of it an average brain washed american viewer certainly would ,0
i caught this movie on the horror channel and was quite impressed by the film s gothic atmosphere and tone as a big fan of all things vampire related i am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos in this case a ghoul like creature residing in a lovecraftian other dimension the director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story the characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind altering substance where a shape shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires whilst draining them of their life essence there are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle i enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story chris ivan cevic and alex petrovich who were very attractive hunks always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers the special effects make up and creature effects were well done and the set design of the vampire s dimension was very effective all in all an enjoyable take on vampire myths and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action the only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity as it would have suited the plot and themes ,1
supercarrier was my favorite movie in the later part of the 80 s when it came out my dad taped it for me i watched it all the time until my step mom taped oprah over it my heart was torn i would love to know if or where i can get it from i have been looking for it i believe they even came out w a supercarrier 2 it wasn t as great as the 1st but i would like to have all of them if i could find them i do not think all that it was a bad movie it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it the actors actresses in the movie were great it also helped me to understand that this is not just a man s world but it is also a woman s world many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do women deserve much respect for their duties as well ,1
dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree but in this movie hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield once i got into the plot of the movie i was hooked but it s just the little things that ultimately murdered the film the concept of the film is great not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt that s about all that is good you can say about the film although hopper did try to act like a tough experienced street smart cop i can t help but feel his acting was below par and there wasn t enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case the directing was also terrible it didn t have the feel of a true film but rather a tv movie production this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion the acting was weak predictable and terribly unexciting that s when i knew that 1st of all the action is going to be atrocious the angling of the camera was amateurish and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer s little sister had no true distinctive effect if it was supposed to be scary it wasn t everyone s acting was terrible and even for hopper i didn t feel for his character and i just didn t really care too much about his relationship with his daughter the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team once i saw the swat team in action i was thinking finally something good but i was wrong 1st of all the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys that is just impossible 2nd of all apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka4 submachine guns with one hand had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun these 4 idiots would ve been blown to bits because they weren t even aiming at anything or paying close attention they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward but it just looks like they re not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around 3rd swat team members do not yell out commands such as keep your eyes open watch out for yourselves are we good to go etc in reality they use hand signals or have radios but they re literally yelling at each other how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you re coming and to top it all off these guys have no plan apparently they re just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase eventually they end up doing nothing that was the last straw i m no expert on special forces but basically what i ve just outlined is pretty common sense when the audience knows the movie is terrible the action pretty much becomes the life saver of the movie when you can t even make an effort to make the action great the movie is lost i give 2 stars for the concept but the rest cannot be credited if you want to watch a crime thriller don t bother with this one there s plenty of crime in the movie but it has the lack of thrill ,0
it s hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts but i know that humor is very subjective i have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff imo and i found this one of their weaker efforts in the year this was made 1930 stan and babe made 15 shorts and one feature they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly in addition this was a time of experimentation for the writers and stan i would say this was an experiment that really did not work as someone else said it does not play to their strengths too much dialog and plot the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as agnes the maid and the great thelma todd talking about girl stuff if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out blotto or brats from the same year they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts they made something like 108 films altogether very few except for the ones made at fox were outright failures but there are some county hospital me and my pal the live ghost the fixer uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts quite a record in my book if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe ,0
the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet maybe there s cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven t reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck obviously there s no family planning in this world either charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g robinson who s old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck there s been a murder committed joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation a multi national concern that has come up with a food product some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world s population it s latest product is soylent green the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people that we ve become a race of cannibals the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative we ve exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive this was the farewell performance of edward g robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia he passed away in real life not many did but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them though the timetable was off it doesn t mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass hopefully we ll have not just the intelligence but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening ,1
i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i don t believe there is a worse movie in the world i hate this movie i hate the acting dialog setting writing and directing i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell damn this disgusting waste of time i pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination i pray that i dreamt the movie and that i will never have to see it at my local video store again burn in hell,0
i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term cult flick it is totally a bad movie but i can t help it i like this movie richard boone has made better and so has joan van arc but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that don t make you think to much this one is for you ,1
hello boys and girls this isn t your regular movie review because this is going to be the cold hard truth are you serious this movie sucked so many balls i couldn t keep them out of my mouth they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen you d need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie the plot was very lacking the actors were terrible i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit do boys everyone peace r h besties4lyf,0
i was going to use the german scream as a summary but that was already taken lol it sums up anatomy nicely provided you re not alien to reading subtitles anatomy fits in snugly with the scream urban legend pack it s a teen horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy provided you re watching the original german language film i can t comment on the dub having not seen the english edition anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up in comparison to it s american counterparts the mystery is uncovered much faster meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal anatomy evolves during it s running time from a slasher come body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller it s a gripping ride from start to finish hats off to the actors involved as well franka potente proves once more that she s an intelligent smart actress who can make any role come to life her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from the spooky lecturers and their teachers pets are equally good a truly foreboding presence at all times it s also astounding that the movie doesn t drag much the pace is fast and punchy very similar to the earlier urban legend meaning that there s always something going on to keep your attention high if there s one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them but if you persevere through the first half s admittedly graphic dissection sequences the latter half with it s exciting thriller overtones will reward you i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teen horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter ,1
i ve never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production while a comedy oldies radio dj in 1988 i got a call from the production company they asked if i d write and record a bit they d drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a tv the television screen itself would never be shown i said sure wrote a parody of 50s sci fi monster clichés rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj pam landry to play the female part as she happened to be on the air at the time she put on a long song joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take giggling she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects we d have never done it if we d known that woodchipper massacre was going to be such a turkey but then again we never got paid for our efforts either gary theroux,0
i wasn t entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought i d give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story won t give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didn t turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely :),0
do you know what farmers spray on fields that s right manure so when the bbc decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about gmos and farming what we got was some of the smelliest manure the bbc has inflicted upon its audience spoilers fields of gold opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist according to the right on trendy bbc all scientists are women announces a new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger then the story switches to another equally bland scene if you re going to make a thriller of any type shouldn t you open with a hook that grabs the audience doctor who was brilliant at this as was the x files while 28 days later opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory i guess someone at the bbc didn t think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance as the not very exciting story continues a couple of journalists one s a drunken man with morals lower than bill clinton and dubya bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting bumped off via mercy killings it s at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by mi5 spooks and the first episode ends with the main mi5 spook getting murdered the second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a vrsa superbug this is when things go totally hay wire all throughout fields of gold the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths but they re not it turns out the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the vrsa superbug in his bedroom and the story ends via the matrix camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with vrsa thereby spreading the superbug throughout the land i find it impossible to say a good word about fields of gold at the time of its broadcast i was both a member of the scottish green party and greenpeace i have since renounced my time in the environmental movement but even now i am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to have the bad guy spreading a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly it s a bit like a cnd member letting off a nuke in london to warn of the dangers of nuclear war i was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being bastards while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men there s also other problems with the script especially with regard to vrsa if unlike the scriptwriters you take the time and trouble to research vrsa you ll find it s entirely different from what is seen here oh and if you set fire to diesel it doesn t explode like napalm perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles jeepers creepers structure wise whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before where as jeepers creepers only lasted about 90 minutes fields of gold lasted twice that length so is doubly irritating and illogicalas a footnote environmentalism never makes a good theme for a thriller anyone remember those steven segal movies and it s about time tv and film producers realized this,0
the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional aimed at a long obsolete target hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all basil rathbone crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire after a while you don t notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda both versions gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol the other obvious candidate at the time the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it ,1
though it hardly compares to other sci fi film giants like 2001 a space odyssey or close encounters of the third kind lifeforce does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements somehow despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same it manages to work because of a few highly different elements loosely based on colin wilson s 1976 novel the space vampires this film from director tobe hooper poltergeist the texas chainsaw massacre focuses on a joint us british mission aboard the british space shuttle churchill to study halley s comet led by an american commander steve railsback they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet s coma and when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft they find alien occupants that look like giant bats later on the churchill reaches earth s orbit but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission s home base the space research center in london columbia is launched to rendezvous with churchill but they find the entire ship gutted by fire all except for the alien beings encased in glass who far from being untouched by the fire look absolutely perfect the aliens are bought back to earth and that s where the incredible happens these space vampires escape from the space research center and instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds suck their victims lifeforce totally out of them one of them is the space girl a thoroughly nude vampiress played by mathilda may railsback the only actual survivor from churchill is bought in by the src s chief frank finlay and a british special agent peter firth to track may who is in telepathic contact with him pretty soon however the vampires have turned london into a scene of pure holocaust people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies and the threat by nato to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large railsback finally catches up with may and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre undoubtedly disjointed unquestionably uneven but nevertheless worth watching lifeforce despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting benefits from some drop dead excellent special effects work by john dykstra star wars some of the best ever seen the other working element and a surprise one it is is the incredible orchestral score by henry mancini almost wagnerian in the same way john williams score for star wars was and mancini like williams before him uses the london symphony orchestra to boot largely forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in 1985 lifeforce if for no other reason should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre there had never been a film quite like it before and there will certainly not be anything like it again ,1
of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn t have anything to it if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is bad they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i don t think it is possible ,0
you know the people in the movie are in for it when king sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but he s too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director writer peter weir already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock 1975 here it s the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man s court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him and then there re those scary dreams that come and go at odd times well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain s wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all it s the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesn t really register the revelation of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus pocus but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells yet it s also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps there s something about past and future to think about here anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you ,1
i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this this my friends is one of the worst tv movies i ve ever seen there is no excitement in this film the story starts out with drew summers candice cameron bure driving to a small town while in a trance she stays with a couple who coincidentally had a daughter named laura fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike thing is laura was killed over a year ago her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered making it look like he had killed her while settling in this town for a while drew starts to have visions and nightmares these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isn t the killer after all throughout the film you find out that ray ordwell sr denis arndt is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her the movie is too long and very boring the film just drags on and on and on and on amazingly i saw another tv movie after this called cloned 1997 which was good but i ll review that one later i give this movie 1 star out of 10 avoid this tv movie it is not worth your time this is the worst tv movie of 1997 ,0
aalcc informs us that 14 year olds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious to those who don t know that the film performs a public service otherwise it s a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason for being i will allow that the camera work is sometimes striking but also that it can be madly self indulgent at other times the actors occupy screen space and screen time but do not compute as compelling human beings i suppose the e mail that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker but i simply couldn t tell enough differences to do so and really didn t care anyway ,0
this movie really sucked hard it was just stupid with a terrible ending i love a really cheesy horror flick but this was terrible the trick ending totally contradicts everything you ve seen in the movie if you last til the end take my advice and steer clear of that dirty old hag the granny ,0
me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie bad idea we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit but our expectations fell extremely short first of all the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies the movie started out slow for the first 1 1 2 hours reminder its about two hours long and when it finally started to gain momentum it sucked plus the plots were very hard to follow it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other if your a person who likes sick twisted unusual movies then go for it but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back unfortunitly no one told us that ,0
discovering something the journey is so much more fun so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world you feel energized invigorated and alive you simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused love and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it is pure bliss where it goes from here is anyone s guess but when you first begin your journey together nothing can compare to it diane lane and richard gere play adrienne willis and dr paul flanner two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals in this film they are about to embark on that mystical journey together where love and the discovery of the emotions along the way will help save them lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex husband who still loves her but in her eyes only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him as hurt as she was by him as much as she really dislikes him there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back why you might ask because in life and love sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence yes this man cheated on her but she has kids with him she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him richard gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father he also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic he is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue this is what brings him to rodanthe in the first place although his lawyer told him not to he felt compelled to visit the woman s husband in rodanthe he stays at the inn that adrienne is taking care of soon they find comfort in each other s arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life by now this sounds like a simple idea for a film and although it might be something you ve seen or read about before gere and lane simply own the film diane lane lights the screen up with her smile her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching gere s character is a little different he is more hardened and bitter it takes adrienne s pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell he blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient on the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault and that she was a 1 in 50 000 casualty but deep down it eats away at him they find each other at a time when both need someone to listen gere and lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers they were married in unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them they have a spark and a real chemistry i would love to see more films with them together in fact i d love to see more films with diane lane but that s a story for another time nights in rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other they both become better people they both become stronger people i enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone not just couples this is a film about redemption absolution and second chances it will also ask you to bring some hankies 8 10,1
this existential thriller in portuguese with english subtitles is a modern version of the american filmes noires of the 40s complete with a surprise twist at the end it is riveting from beginning to end my only criticism is its poor production values the film looks cheaply made and it probably was so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of godard in vivre sa vie to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier most maddening of all the subtitles are often hard to read when will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background i d give this an 8 overall although with better production values it could have been higher ,1
i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9 dunderklumpen is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way it reminded me of hrpuffinstuff on sat mornings its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes don t expect older kids to be interested as the live action animation is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored this is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974 ,0
terrible direction from an awful script even the dvd looked muddy and out of focus laughable accents all over the map unlike most of the other commenters i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn out shots of nude or scantily clad young men usually wet or glistening with sweat looking longingly at each other ,0
yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal ,0
i don t understand why people would praise this garbage its wrong stupid unrealistic awful and just about everything else the film is a view on life racial issues prejudice and everything else that strangely goes on in college this is where it fails it has no grasps on reality from many questionable non sense scenes in the movie such as for examplea black man chasing down a white man with a gun the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them the same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs bust a rhymesanother critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters from the scared and confused white people and the mean angry and yet rightful black people its almost as its an insult to both black and white people i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters one a black athlete the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex rape fights love hate prejudice racial war and oh yeah don t forget education which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out in which after they go back to their boring lives and think being white is bad does this sound alot like your college years didn t think so i don t think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess overall this is a really bad bad ugly movie if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys just avoid this mess ,0
such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow up should be it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of australian history legend and horses the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism the plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry the lead cast from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton and a well replaced brian dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film as far as sequels can go the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again ,1
mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits the special effects look like they are from the 70 s the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain awful the only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids there are far better shows for your kids to watch try giving your kids something like nickelodean those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers ,0
spoiler alert personally i don t understand why pete did not help to save williams life i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated or forced i think secret service members are every day people and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service now he s motivations are clear well known but as a rental this film will not satisfy you cause the old but used twists the average acting these are just things in this film only for keep you wait the end clark johnson as the director of s w a t did a far better work like this time and i still wondering how the producers for example michael douglas left this film to theaters ,0
i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio a skateboard chase scene jodie foster in her first grown up role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that i ll never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldn t have cared less the story of california teens in the 1970 s where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots don t waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie ,0
wow so my boyfriend and i went to the movie store to rent a film i like dumb horror movies so i browsed the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of michael moore s sicko so then i found the worst of all of them as i would soon find out it looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough the fact that there was an imdb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way so the next night we put it in the dvd player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused the movie is utterly incoherent with badly placed time jumps from past to future that leave you asking a major wtf the plot has no sort of coherent story other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder but this only actually comes into play in the movie in the last twenty minutes of it so pretty much for the first hour you have this random confusing time jumps incoherent plot parents who don t age bad acting bad dialogue a boy who magically changes hair colour and a host of obnoxious characters for you to get bored with the movie moves so slow that it s a chore to actually sit there and watch i d rather be scrubbing the toilets honestly don t bother with it ,0
i am totally addicted to this show i can t wait till the week goes by to see the next showing it s a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape monarch cove simon rex is the best actor on the show it is suspenseful and exciting i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn t going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it s my favorite show i am really mean it ,1
i didn t agree with any of the theology in the left behind series but nonetheless i found the books gripping and i read 8 of 12 of them undeniably good writing and interesting story however i didn t have very high expectations for the movie there was no way mainstream hollywood would have taken up a christian series and produced a big budget movie so it was done independently and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show it just didn t feel like a movie it didn t have that movie experience to it if anybody knows what i m talking about so the movie suffered because of that and the low budget poor special effects were another detraction for me on top of that i feel that gordon currie was woefully miscast as nicolie carpathia reading the book my impression of nc was that he was supposed to be this charming dazzling amazingly handsome guy who spoke english with almost zero trace of an accent so i imagined somebody like pierce brosnan in the role instead they found some clay aiken pencil neck who looks like an employee of the month from best buy and gave him a really bad fake accent so that lost a few stars for me right there a movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn t look or sound the way he s supposed to the acting was okay but nothing to write home about some of the scenes like one of the conversion scenes can t remember which one were real seat squirmers for me and some of the christian rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes like in the one with kirk cameron praying in the bathroom in short it wasn t a bad movie but it just didn t do it for me stick to the book folks it s much better ,0
 hannibal spoilers hannibal lecter anthony hopkins is back for a travesty of a movie now he s in italy appreciating our food including people such as rinaldo pazzi giancarlo giannini but comes back to the states for clarice julianne moore and to even the score with a former victim mason verger gary oldman let me tell you this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the lambs and manhunter because it s truly completely absolutely totally bad i mean the scene near the end with ray liotta s cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain sautéed wtf then why the hell was everybody so annoying including clarice and why did the story keep going nowhere i suppose that this is the teen chapter of the hannibal series terrible stupid gory for gore s sake and totally embarrassing don t watch it especially if you love any other of the hannibal movies sotl manhunter red dragon hannibal rising hannibal 1 10 ,0
i like the wind and the lion very much it was a good movie i thought that since i m young and it was made so long ago i wouldn t like it all that good but after i saw it i was amazed of how good it was my family liked it my friends liked it everyone i showed it to liked it i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in morroco was treated during the early 1900 s by the germans french and even the americans if i was a high school history teacher i would definitely show it to my student s from a high schooler s point of view i give this movie a good 10 out of 10 my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves my little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it systemoffell,1
it s a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are 2 minus points the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring a lot of stories are not self contained if you compare to f e coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall it s one of the best movies this year for sure annoying that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum i haven t got more to say and i don t want to start analyzing the single sequences well i think that s it ,1
instead go to the zoo buy some peanuts and feed em to the monkeys monkeys are funny people with amnesia who don t say much just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny black comedy there isn t a black person in it and there isn t one funny thing in it either walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack it s labeled unrated i think they took out the topless scene they may have taken out other stuff too who knows all we know is that whatever they took out isn t there any more the acting seemed ok to me there s a lot of unfathomables tho it s supposed to be a city it s supposed to be a big lake if it s so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing coats ,0
this makes the third errol morris movie i ve seen and i m increasingly not liking his style he seems to find very interesting and varied characters great personalities to create documentaries for and then with tongue in cheek editing make fun of everything they are about it s never really a direct caricaturation of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying but no no these people are really fascinating really but there s always these subtle little canted angles and not so subtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their back this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation a man who studies african hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant like a lion tamer a man who keeps a garden full of animal shaped shrubbery and a robot designer the general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal human and life features so the title of fast cheap out of control doesn t really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie right except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals passions he might call them obsessions making synthetic designs on life i share not that fear and honestly don t appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the film but i stress his subtlety with no voice over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees it s not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators collective head instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they re taken out of the context of the circus and the ants showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about i don t find them absurd i find them all very neat and interesting individuals unless of course he didn t intend such juxtapositions which means he s just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter considering none of this films i ve seen so far have particularly impressed me i don t really care to find out what he s trying to do polarisdib,0
louis creed a doctor from chicago moves to a large house near a small town since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine s along with him is his wife rachel and their two kids ellie and gage as well as ellie s cat church soon they met their new neighbor and old man named judd crandall judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house that is constantly a way used by big trucks but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children since she has traumas from her sister zelda s death during the first week of the family in the new house louis already has dead people to deal with victor pascow a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident addresses his dying words to louis personally even though the two men are strangers on the night following pascow s death louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not go beyond no matter how much you feel you need to louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles anyway he dismisses the dream many strange things starts to happen and church ellie s cat dies while walking on the highway louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church s death with ellie but judd sympathizing with him jud takes louis to the pet cemetery supposedly to bury church but instead of stopping there jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to the real cemetery an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac indians there louis buries the cat on jud s instruction with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life and that is where the real horror story begins i personally find this movie very good it s not the most horrifying of all but it is one of the best horror movies i watched the way gage dies is almost impossible to not stay in your memory specially being a toddler it s cool to see stephen king s cameo as the minister of the funeral of course there are some script errors how can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters things like that doesn t make any sense but i can understand that all horror s scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work a good thing i saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesn t help anything because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn t be back again all the nightmare began ,1
mean spirited and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children s tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made ,0
wow i was told this would be a b movie worth watching i feel that i was misled after seeing this preview event the plot is a twisted make of several films at best even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit i am sorry to say that i was taken to the cleaners i wouldn t waste your time on this one this movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera being in the entertainment business i can judge a decent film and this one deserves to be shelved or discarded my advice stick to a classic like the 1979 dawn of the dead on a scale of 1 to 10 even a 1 is being nice to producers because this movie blows below limit of what sucks the producers need to stay with their daytime jobs if you do view the movie please be honest in your posting this one seems to have been hyped up and inflated by a few there are a few who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly sorry but i have to say this is one to be skipped ,0
we rented the dvd hoping for a good western the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable but the ideas were very bad here are my problems with the film in the first part why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers at least keep us guessing no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee very long delay in much of anything happening absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in laws even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee wouldn t he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail overall very sad acting and no point to movie ,0

after waking up at 3 30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep deprivation this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it what a mistake here is the plot potential spoilers if you even care a neurotic man with an addiction to candy josh kornbluth works as a temp for some ridiculous company suddenly he is offered the chance to go perm which seems to be the favorite catch phrase of this movie but with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn t want to do it he hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt his inability to send several very important letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious but is merely stupid josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together obviously a fantasy of josh s in real life as such a thing would never happen a bunch of other stuff happens but it s too trite and inane to go into now despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy i only laughed twice during it the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth my initial reaction was one of stifling fear and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman yeah right josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying looking person i have ever seen in my life he is an unattractive overweight balding jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women i do not at all sympathize with josh s character he is lazy and unmotivated and i just don t appreciate the failed attempts at humor skip it even if your life depends upon it ,0
i had the privilege of watching holly at the edinburgh film festival last week what a powerful and moving story holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia patrick an american comes into holly s life and decides he wants to help her when holly is sold again patrick desperately searches for her we follow they re difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore ,1
i saw marigold at a preview showing a few days ago and found it to be a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film the film is about a not so successful american actress who goes to india to act in a low budget film only to find herself stranded there when she finds on arrival that the film s financing has vanished along with the producers and investors a chance encounter with an indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in that since indian films incorporate a significant amount of singing and dancing this is a problem for marigold who has two left feet not to mention a personality so tightly wound up and thorny that she can hardly hear the music let alone feel it as prem the choreographer of the film advices her to do but prem the word not the person means love and prem the person not the word seems to embody that emotion in the way he deals with all around him whether it be his production assistant friends who introduced marigold to the shoot the narcissistic and arrogant leads of the film or the bitchy and uptight marigold herself soon under his expert tutelage and endearing treatment marigold finds her feet literally and figuratively i must say a word for those not familiar with the use of song and dance in indian films unlike american musicals the story progresses through these dance numbers as plot developments unfold and character transformations occur in parallel with the dancing it should also be pointed out that indian dance is about a lot more than mere movement an essential part of it is the enactment of the dancer s feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance this is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer that marigold reaches this stage of accomplishment is demonstrated in a stunning dance number about midway through when marigold while performing the dance she is required to do for the film within the film also expresses her love for prem it is an amazing performance by ali larter especially when one considers that she is not used to dancing in her films or emoting her character s feelings via dance it shows her skill as an actress as well as how much hard work she has put into the role of course no romantic film can work without a credible prince charming salman khan who plays the role of prem fits the role to a t even when it turns out that he is a prince not so charming he does not lose the audience s sympathy salman has been ruling hindi cinema sometimes called bollywood for many years now and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also as prem he is completely charming sweet adorable sexy and vulnerable for those who have never encountered him on screen before be prepared to be hit with mega doses of sheer magnetism he and ali larter make a lovely pair and are as well matched in their acting as in their appearance will they manage to work out their problems it doesn t seem possible as we hear the last song of the film a lovely blending of fact and fantasy reality and metaphor the ending certainly took some of the audience i saw it with by surprise but they were left satisfied the songs are used very cleverly they are in hindi unsubtitled for the film within the film sequences and in english for other occasions but their meaning is always clear from the context and choreography marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy yes there is quite a bit of humor as well in it the indian locations and costumes give it a fairy tale quality befitting a story which can be likened to a modern fairy tale if you are or have been curious about indian cinema but were hesitant to try it this is an excellent introduction it captures the color and vibrancy of indian films not only in the costumes and jewelry which are quite impressive but also in the lively dances and world sound music if you are a fan of ali larter you should watch it for her excellent acting in portraying a selfish demanding high maintanance woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men if you are a girl you will enjoy admiring ali s lovely costumes and ogling her hunk of a leading man if you are a guy you can not only admire ali in her sexy costumes but learn from salman khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart even from someone as edgy as marigold ,1
this movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen but it s got quite a bit of quality it s pretty lifelike yet you think it s only a movie duvall and close portray common people and you d never even realize they are now big name actors it seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing eugene s girlfriend but i guess it s possible it seems unlikely that the kid would travel from montana to nevada by himself but i guess it s possible you might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family but i guess it s possible i remember glenn close saying something like you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life but it isn t ,1

as everyone knows nobody can play scarlett o hara like vivien leigh and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable all others pale in comparison and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions one thing that i really couldn t get past was that joanne has brown eyes the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett s good looks and in this sequel she has been stripped of those the movie as well as the book had several lulls in it the new characters weren t all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever it could be that i m only 11 but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up if rhett hadn t told her that i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude she really loved cat her baby she likes this child best because she had it with rhett her only loved husband still if you ve read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in scarlett s world quite frankly it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together and scarlett took way too long to get to that it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind but then again what isn t if you have read the novel you will like that better than the movie i would watch it just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind regardless of whether or not it s worthwhile it may not satisfy you entirely but it will get you some of the way there ,0
over powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies check weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything check mobile suits based on angels check ok its a gundam series this one gundam wing has good character development real world complexity interesting ideas and some pretty eye candy with characters the initially weak relena dorlan later peacecraft then back to dorlan gets stronger and more independent although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy the series main character the aforementioned heero initially a cold hard butcherer becomes more and more human while still remaining in character and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise float between oz freelance and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good reflecting how the real world works however in 49 half hour episodes it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn t used to its full potential the ideas at the core of the series the necessity of fighting the desire for peace etc are ones that resonate even today in retrospect the series was ahead of its time what with the war on terrorism and all but its exploration of these ideas the monologues especially those of treize kushrenada is an incredible dramatic piece forming some of the best writing in the series but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge in terms of eye candy which is what this one has in bucketloads everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra no not the tampons you idiot is wells designed and explodes in big balls of orange which is bad because better animation would ve had better explosions but who cares stuff explodes and thats all that matters in short though the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes you ve missed out on a lot the poor writing can leave you cringing and sometimes the animation makes you go wtf but this is made up for in its classic animation style its scale sparks of incredible dialogue and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations ,1
there is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by cary grant jayne mansfield ray walston and werner klemperer those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by stanley donen whose comic touch was so evident in among others damn yankees bedazzled and charade for the first five minutes or so it seems that those expectations might be met and then nothing what is supposed to be a light comedy plunges into leaden heavy handed melodrama with nary a chuckle to be had relative newcomer suzy parker has often been criticized for her performance or lack of one in this film but in a movie in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden attacking parker seems unfair not even as bright a light as an audrey hepburn or doris day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering dreary and wholly pointless script which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer s interest and patience down with it the rest of the cast especially ray walston keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation the desperate inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film s final moments only serves to add insult to injury this film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels ,0
i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on a e i ve been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid and love catching ghost hunters when it s on scifi channel i ve tried to watch three episodes of paranormal state and only use up my time commenting on it because it s so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak paranormal state is beyond cheesy cheesy director s log voice overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be evil and the work of a demonic spirit then come the exorcists demonologists psychics like in poltergeist you almost expect the team to leave and say this house is clear i very much appreciate the ghost hunters approach where they go in to disprove claims then take away what they can and they are almost always reassuring to the client if they find anything that haunted does not equal evil paranormal state is not so bad it s good it s just plain bad didn t a e used to stand for arts entertainment the art part has long been gone and the entertainment factor is now waning as well ,0
good performances can t save this terrible script larded with every cliche in the chick flick book both main characters are deeply unsympathetic and the scene where laura linney s character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son which i think is supposed to be poignant is just horrifying ,0
frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but he can t avoid running into his old friends he had been arrested originally not for any drug related charge but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game his skill at poker has earned him the nickname of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being his former heroin connection want him to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident zosch eleanor parker and make up with his old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatra s mental state when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him but when a promised phone call doesn t come one day he descends into depression and goes back on the smack later when he finally gets to audition he arrives completely strung out his embarrassment when he can t play the correct beat is devastating he had such big dreams and the other musicians don t even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows frank s drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer bernstein s score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don t like about the film is the ending spoilersalthough i really like the character of zosch and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes zosch s death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he won t go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there s always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it harms the film a little but as it stands it s still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10 ,1

the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was re broadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the 20th century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a women only section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all time great movie moments i don t think of this as a gay movie it s an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd ,1

many movies try to take universal themes and make a comedy but few will rise to the occasion like checking out the movie is brilliant the dialogue is well written and true to form the acting is absolutely prima peter falk has given a truly great performance as an actor as an actor he is able to carry the cast to greatness another great performance is given by laura san giacomo she is such an intriguing actress her performances take one by surprise she delivers no matter what role she is asked to give from wacko in stephen king s the stand to her television performances however checking out allows her to shine it is a role she is meant to play the film is brilliantly directed by jeff hare he was able to bring out the best in his cast and his direction in every aspect made the film a wonderful treasure jeff hare was able to make a difficult theme laughable and yet profound he gives us an up close and personal look at why indie films need to be made the directors knowledge of his cast and script are extended to the finished film the results are superb hopefully it will be made available to large audiences because this is one you won t want to miss it has the potential of being the sleeper hit of 2005 in the fashion of my big fat greek wedding ,1
schlocky 70s horror films ya gotta love em in contrast to today s boring slasher flicks these k tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula this is a b movie about the making of a b movie that went horribly wrong faith domergue this island earth stars as an over the hill b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home her boyfriend director who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude is filming on location and on a tight schedule the ken doll co star discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add realism unfortunately realism is something they could have done without john carradine having long since given up looking for the 17th gland the unearthly now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate he goes about his daily work but always seems to run afoul of the director the horror builds slowly a dead cat here john carradine entering a grave there finally culminating in seven yes seven murders at least there s truth in advertising it s just sad that the ghoul didn t understand that there was a movie being made above him how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work face it you just can t go around tugging on satan s coat and expect him to take it lying down sterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses ,0
this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending or maybe a crying game surprise and the best soundtrack i ve probably ever heard if that all make sense the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you re in for a twisted ride i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere but from there the film settles down into a talk fest between two really damaged people daphne and buddy they re lonely mess up and boy do they talk about sex daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting some are quite funny mr chang some disturbing the harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what s going on or what daphne is really feeling and because i have a friend who used to escort i might add most seem quite real you are alone is multi layered and mostly brilliant okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and i don t know that we d have missed anything then again i need to see it again knowing the ending i like this movie the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them request granted ,1
face it folks dk3 is more challenging innovative and clever than its predecessor challenging its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time one especially difficult level is called lightning lookout in which you may be struck by lightning at any given time innovative it opened a lot of doors too bad the snes died out not long after this title and clever the level names range from trademark plays on words lake orangatanga to witty references that the game s targeted audience won t get for many years to come bleak s house what irks me about most people s criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words kiddy kong he is a worthy little buddy successor to diddy kong and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as that retarded monkey dk3 will remain a classic until the end of time ,1
i reflect back to the days when i held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when i was 16 the little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years now at my age i want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments that if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter but then again young people today are faced with some variables that i never had to deal with a youth the three main characters well played by all three actors kerry wahington lanisha anna simpson joycelyn and melissa martinez maria give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations they have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day the have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models these situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day they except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with finding true love in a male having good friends that you can depend on gaining some respect love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life this is were this film cross the race age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped the director and writer mckay explains on the dvd how each of scenes got into his head by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best the one thing i know about african americans and hispanics is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent this was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and i understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves the hope factor i now think about my future and where i have come from and say as lanisha did today is a good day yes poverty still exists racism sexism and any other ism that we can added yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self destructive everything around them is impoverished but none of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future i was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision i suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place ,1
although the story is good and portrayals what i expected of sam elliot my dvd copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems the dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film i would therefore be very careful in purchasing any dvd of the film without checking for the problem i would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usage this film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes i can recommend it to prospective viewers,0
 zu the warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui hark s use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zu warriors from magic mountain it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesn t matter it is all about the action and adventure i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we know he made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screen you simply won t believe i think it is a big shame that this movie wasn t shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor in most of tsui harks s movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic ,1
owen david krumholtz and chloe denise richards are a youngish couple living in manhattan owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress happily for her chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to hollywood missing her owen books a flight to lala land as a surprise when he arrives at her set trailer however the house is shaking as chloe and her hunky co star are having a little romantic tryst the writer and the actress are through hurt and mad as a hatter owen goes back to nyc sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with nadine milla jovovich to get him out of his sulky funk but it goes badly as the duo mix like oil and water mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen s huge shoulder chip yet over the next few months astonishingly nadine and owen become pals who confide in each other and hang out can it turn into something more well who the heck cares this film is so stupid that most folks will yank it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes the script is pathetic dismal and oh stupid too then again krumholtz gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout william baldwin too reaches a career low with his crude and sex crazy role as owen s brother the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one okay the costumes and production values are adequate then too there is one clever element in that occasionally the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking that doesn t save the film from bomb status don t be stupid dear film and romcom lovers do not rent buy or borrow this gigantic turkey i am the stupidest person on earth today for watching this thing until the bitter end ,0
spoiler alert i worked as an extra on this lifetime tv movie filmed in seattle it s really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie because usually they are still in the process of either still writing parts as was the case here or making editing cuts and major changes from the final parts my husband and i both worked as extras in this movie and i recall them discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end frankly i never thought margaret colin s character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run lying to police covering up etc could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma okay just something to think about by the way i play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often we ve counted four times margaret colin was great to work with and very down to earth although lisa vidal now a lifetime regular was aloof overall the movie turned out to be about a 7 10 but like another poster commented is still a real tear jerker and makes a great saturday afternoon cable flick ,1
chris rock stars in this remake of warren beatty s heaven can wait itself a remake of the 1941 film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then los angeles rams in rock s hipper version our lead character is a struggling young and decidedly low talent standup comedian it s very funny to see the razor sharp rock playing a bad comedian it s kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance barton s dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a non amateur night but every time he tries out his material he s booed off the stage lustily so much so that his nickname becomes booie his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock isn t lance is also a bike messenger and he s riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when bam he s hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no dice it appears lance isn t due in heaven until 2044 so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this fella a mr wellington owns all kinds of things he s the 15th richest man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around but of course while in the body of the affluent mr wellington lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker regina king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you re an dumpy old white guy and it s even worse when she s not impressed by your money this is rock s first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there s still a lot of the standup comedian in him and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script but this isn t really a bad thing rock s personality his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film he s clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him ,1
i actually trawled through the entire set of reviews searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars they were few and far between which is utterly baffling yes i know it s a disney film and it isn t directed by christopher nolan but good lord this is straight to the bargain bucket nonsense they should ve had done with it and animated the bloody thing and what s even worse is the fact that imdb won t let me simply finish my rant there because my review needs to be longer the awesome in game camera shots are literally taken from tiger woods pga tour golf on the playstation the story plods like a sulking school boy the multi stranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup and the grand finale is plain boring aside from that it really was the greatest film i ve ever seen in my entire life good authentic looking costumes sets and sports equipment there i said it ,0
for my humanities quarter project for school i chose to do human trafficking after some research on the internet i found this dvd and ordered it i just finished watching it and i am still thinking about it all i can say is wow it is such a compelling story of a 12 year old vietnamese girl named holly and an american man named patric who tries to save her the ending leaves you breathless and although it s not a happily ever after ending it is very realistic it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone you really connect with holly and patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next ,1
i have to admit this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears however i always think about things twice and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable i prefer taking the risk of a closer look first what s first the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow paced movie that doesn t try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9 11 thumbs up for this stroke of genius because unlike stone s world trade center this film fortunately doesn t focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating the psychological impact the sheer devastation that 9 11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 9 11 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar however in the film blood diamond the di caprio character says and i quote ah these americans always want to take about their feelings now i don t want to belittle their sufferíngs but i sure would like to make a comparison ever since 9 11 the entire world is confronted with mementos memorials and commemorations of 9 11 the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 9 11 in their works now this huge amount of cultural products dealing with 9 11 turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject and i say this with all due respect blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion fact is people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people we have a war in iraq in afghanistan in birma and lots of other countries on a daily basis we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9 11 simply because they are black and because their lives don t have much in common with our western lives africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can so what i am saying is this the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9 11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9 11 not a day goes by without a newspaper article a film or a book that discusses 9 11 in conclusion i commiserated with charlie fineman but i wasn t sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war you catch my thrift ,1
this showed up on a dvd a buddy of mine bought for me they had it listed as the savage guns which was an entirely different movie obviously the folks who packaged the dvd never bothered to look at what they were burning on the disk anyway this movie is about as bad as they come the sound track is a combination tv batman early james bond spaghetti western lots of galloping around to this music it appears that the guy has to gallop between scenes to burn up some time and give the sound track folks something to do english is dubbed over the italian and it really shows i wish it had been just a little bit worse and then it would have had some of the campy feel of the ed wood films as it is it is just plain awful ,0
 and normally i don t like surprises watch this movie by chance in a motel in south africa second week of a three month motorbiking holiday in za apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously just watched the million dollar baby and had to look up hillary swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb didn t realise she was the solicitor in the red dust well now i m not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of clint before now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write ok here it goes i think if you are from a western country especially europe watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there so this hopefully will fill ten lines ,1
rachel and chuck yoman valerie harper gerald mcraney decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family so they packed up their reluctant son gregory togel and daughter tammy lauren and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a mayberry feel later the residence seems to be more like the people in deliverance soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get ax cepted as the antagonists can the ignored young stevie save his parents or will their pursuer s put his her foot in it this film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces they could not have chosen better actors and daryl anderson was exceptionally creepy an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs ,1
wow i thought eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete in this case the well known german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap harte jungs is stupid not believable and predictable and above all not funny it s almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany and i m afraid also austria tobias schenke 19 looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15 and his character is too dumb to be true schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn t know anything about sex but that doesn t help harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan jürgens who play schenke s semi liberal parents perlinger and jürgens are stand up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting still their performances are the best and funniest in comparison a complete failure ,0
